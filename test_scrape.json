      "description": "These photographs show the appearance of a circumscribed choroidal hemangioma before and after treatment with photodynamic therapy (PDT).  The lesion appeared as an elevated choroidal mass with overlying orange plaques and RPE atrophy.  Vascular leakage from the lesion resulted in macular edema overlying the lesion, as seen in the OCT, and surrounding subretinal fluid resulting in an exudative retinal detachment, as seen on the B-scan echography.  A-scan echography revealed high internal reflectivity, which is typical for these lesions.  Overlying fibrosis can be seen in the post-treatment photograph.  The treatment resulted in a reduction in tumor height and decreased subretinal fluid.  It was successful in decreasing the patient's metamorphopsia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1a\n\n\n Enlarge\n Download\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1b\n\n\n Enlarge\n Download\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1c: OCT\n\n\n Enlarge\n Download\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1d: B-scan ultrasound\n\n\n Enlarge\n Download\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1e: A-scan ultrasound\n\n\n Enlarge\n Download\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1f\n\n\n Enlarge\n Download",
