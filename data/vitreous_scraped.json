      "description": "APMPPE is one of the white dot syndromes that occurs in young healthy adults and similarly affects males and females. It is usually bilateral, although may be worse in one eye. APMPPE is generally a self-limited condition that requires no treatment and has a good prognosis. A 47-year-old female presents with a four day history of fluttering bright spots in the right eye. She denies a viral prodrome or headaches. Color fundus photo, right eye (OD): Multiple creamy yellow-white lesions throughout the macula",

      "description": "Pseudohypopyon is a relatively rare manifestation of leukemia. It occurs most often in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and may be seen during a blast crisis or as a sign of relapse [1]. Rapid development of an atypical, blood-stained hypopyon that fails to respond to corticosteroid therapy is classic for leukemic pseudohypopyon [2]. Pseudohypopyon is distinguished from infectious or inflammatory hypopyon by the absence of an associated fibrin reaction. This pseudohypopyon was the first sign of this 56-year-old patient's acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapse. Timely anterior chamber aspiration with cytology and systemic malignancy work-up are paramount to ensuring appropriate diagnosis and treatment",

      "description": "Cilioretinal artery occlusion (CLRAO) often occurs in the setting of a central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). This lack of perfusion in the cilioretinal artery results from a functional hemodynamic block as the low perfusion pressure of the choroid, which supplies the cilioretinal artery, is unable to overcome the elevated venous pressure which results from the CRVO. The central retinal artery, however, is still able to perfuse due to its baseline higher perfusion pressure and ability to autoregulate its intraluminal pressure. In this photo, there are diffusely scattered intraretinal hemorrhages and cotton wool spots with associated venous distention and tortuosity secondary to the CRVO. Note the area of retinal whitening extending from the temporal disc into the macula in the region perfused by the cilioretinal artery. The fluorescein angiogram confirms that this is a cilioretinal artery as it fills with the choroid, prior to the filling of the central retinal artery",

Additional findings include graying of the parafoveal retina, superficial crystalline deposits, subfoveal cavities, and right-angle vessels. Symptoms include blurred vision, metamorphopsia and paracentral scotomas. Fluorescein angiography will highlight the parafoveal telangiectatic vessels that show early hyperfluorescence with late leakage. OCT will show subfoveal cystoid spaces without cystoid macular edema. Fundus autofluorescence is very diagnostic in that the normal hypoautofluorescence at the fovea is lost and will show abnormally increased foveal autofluorescence",

Due to its density, low viscosity, and immiscibility in water, the PFO is able to displace sub-retinal fluid and blood anteriorly, allowing for retinal unfolding and stabilization during repair. PFO has been observed to be safe and effective in the management of retinal detachments. Possible complications include increased intraocular pressure, hypotony, decreased visual acuity, retained PFO, need for re-operation, and cataract formation. However, complication rates after the use of PFO were shown to be comparable to other intraoperative retinal attachment management options",

Other associated findings can include enlongated ciliary processes, prominent radial vessels or neovascularization on the iris surface, shallow anterior chamber with narrow-angle glaucoma, vitreous hemorrhage, and retinal detachment. In this photograph, a stalk can be seen emanating from the optic disc into the vitreous with tenting of the surrounding retina and dragging of the macula.

The lesions are flat, sharply circumscribed, placoid, chalky white, and lie at the level of the RPE.

The IOFB was removed with a rare earth magnet via pars plana approach.

Visual acuity on presentation was 20/25 in both eyes, and funduscopic examination revealed an isolated cilioretinal artery occlusion (CLRAO) in his right eye (Figure 1). Work-up revealed significant right internal carotid artery stenosis (>50%). A right carotid endarterectomy was performed, and vascular risk factors were optimized. Visual acuity was stable at 20/25 one month after presentation. CLRAO accounts for ~5-7% of retinal artery occlusions and is usually associated with a central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) or anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION)",

On the optical coherence tomogram below, there are parafoveal intraretinal cysts with exudates. Diabetic macular edema can result in diffuse or focal areas of swelling and retinal thickening and may be associated with hard exudates. Diabetic macular edema is often classified based on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS), which defined clinically significant diabetic macular edema. However, these findings are based on the funduscopic examination and in classifying this edema based on optical coherence tomography (OCT), the term center-involving macular edema is often used. Treatment includes the use of anti-VEGF drugs but may also include the use of focal or grid pattern photocoagulation or pars plana vitrectomy",

It occurs most often in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and may be seen during a blast crisis or as a sign of relapse [1]. Rapid development of an atypical, blood-stained hypopyon that fails to respond to corticosteroid therapy is classic for leukemic pseudohypopyon [2]. Pseudohypopyon is distinguished from infectious or inflammatory hypopyon by the absence of an associated fibrin reaction. This pseudohypopyon was the first sign of this 56-year-old patient's acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapse.

      "description": "A 20-year-old male was referred by an optometrist because of a pigmented scar in the right eye. The patient complained of black spots in his vision for the past week. He had no pain or irritation. He was born in Peru, but came to the United States at the age of 14 and lived in Tennessee on a farm and had been exposed to many cats in the past. He had no other complaints or medical problems. Vision with correction: OD 20/25-1; OS 20/20 Intraocular pressure: normal OU Slit lamp examination OU: unremarkable; no AC cells; no posterior synechiae; clear lens Fig 1: Dilated fundus examination of the right eye showed a well-circumscribed small old peripheral pigmented scar just beyond the inferotemporal arcades, with a patchy area of active chorioretinitis inferiorly",

Retained PFCL in the anterior chamber has been reported to cause inflammation, secondary glaucoma, and corneal toxicity. This 17-year-old male sustained an open globe injury at age 11, and subsequently underwent open globe repair, phacoemulsifcation with intraocular lens placement, and pars plana vitrectomy for tractional retinal detachment.

Silicone oil on an IOL is seen as variable sized droplets that are adherent to the surface of the IOL. These can be visually significant to varying degrees based on size and location of the droplets. The picture represents a patient who underwent cataract surgery with placement of a 3-piece silicone IOL about 3 years prior to presenting with a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment requiring pars plana vitrectomy with silicone oil placement and scleral buckle. He later presented with this large silicone oil droplet adherent to the posterior surface of his IOL. He went on to have an IOL exchange with silicone oil removal",

Serous retinal detachment and suprachoroidal collection of serous fluid may be seen and confirmed with transillumination of the globe or ultrasonography. Other examination findings may include leopard-spotted changes in the retinal pigment epithelium (indicating chronicity), normal intraocular pressure (as opposed to hypotonous choroidal effusion), vitreous cell, dilation of episcleral blood vessels, and blood in Schlemm's canal. Due to the idiopathic nature, the diagnosis is made after excluding other causes of effusion such as inflammation or infection, neoplasm, or trauma. Effective treatment often involves sclerotomy, quadrantic sclerectomy, and/or decompression of vortex veins",

      "description": "Updated: August 18, 2025; Original: September 9, 2013 Myelination of the optic nerve fibers normally begins at the lateral geniculate body and ceases at the lamina cribosa. However, in some individuals areas of the retinal nerve fiber layer can also become myelinated. Classically, this finding is unilateral and peripapillary in location, appearing as a white, flame-shaped area with feathered borders as seen in the top photo. However, it can also present bilaterally in 7% of these patients as illustrated in the middle photo.(1) The bottom photo shows a less common presentation affecting a more extensive distribution of the peripheral nerve fibers. Note how the nerve fibers temporal to the macula respect the horizontal raphe, a concept not easily visualized under normal conditions",
