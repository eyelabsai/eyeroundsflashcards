      "description": "A 50-year-old male presented with 10 days of progressive vision loss in the left eye (OS) as well as fevers, fatigue, and unintentional weight loss. Visual acuity was hand motion OS. Slitlamp examination showed 1+ anterior vitreous cells. On funduscopy, he had severe optic disc edema with 360 degrees of peripapillary cotton wool spots and nerve fiber layer hemorrhages, along with a serous retinal detachment with peripapillary yellowish inflammation in the outer retina around the disc (A). He was found to have active syphilis with AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). He was treated with penicillin at that time and anti-retroviral therapy was ultimately initiated by the infectious diseases service",

      "description": "Posted: May 1, 2018 The patient presented with acute onset of blurry vision in both eyes associated with blood pressures exceeding 190/140 mmHg. On dilated exam, both eyes had a flame hemorrhage along the vascular arcade and shifting subretinal fluid in the macula. Acute systemic hypertension more commonly manifests as flame shaped hemorrhages in the nerve fiber layer, but serous retinal detachments have also been reported.[1,2]",
