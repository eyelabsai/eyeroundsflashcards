The edema usually clears over time, but the ruptures in Descemet's membrane persist. The residual corneal changes can result in anisometropia and the main cause of vision loss after such an injury is anisometropic amblyopia. Descemet's membrane ruptures from forceps injury tend to be oriented vertically or obliquely, while those secondary to congenital glaucoma (Haab's striae) are most commonly horizontal. This photograph shows obliquely-oriented ruptures in Descemet's membrane resulting from forceps injury in a 4-year-old girl. The patient had anisometropic amblyopia",

      "description": "A woman in her 40s presented due to persistent redness and foreign body sensation several weeks after an ocular injury from a pellet gun. She was found to have a nasal subconjunctival metallic foreign body with scarring of the plica semilunaris (Figure 1). Dilated fundus exam showed mild vitreous hemorrhage and a nasal peripheral region of hypopigmented scarring as well as intra- and subretinal hemorrhage, consistent with chorioretinitis sclopetaria (Fgiure 2). Chorioretinitis sclopetaria is a full-thickness rupture and retraction of the retina and choroid due to blunt trauma from a high velocity projectile, often leaving visible bare sclera at the injury site. This patient\u2019s subconjunctival pellet was successfully surgically removed, and there was no evidence of scleral laceration or intraocular penetration. Ultra-widefield imaging on follow up 2 weeks later showed interval improvement in the intra- and subretinal hemorrhage with chorioretinal atrophy (Figure 3)",

The blood accumulates between the sclera and the conjunctiva and appears as a red spot on the white of the eye. The bleeding can be caused by trauma, hypertension, elevated venous pressure (e.g., Valsalva maneuver, coughing, vomiting), anticoagulant therapy, and acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis [1]. The most common risk factors in younger patients are trauma and contact lens usage [2]",
