The condition typically results in mild to moderate bilateral vision loss with an insidious onset beginning in childhood. Note the symmetric temporal wedges of disc pallor in the photographs.

      "title": "Intrapapillary Hemorrhage",
      "description": "A 62-year-old female with primary open angle glaucoma was seen in the glaucoma clinic for follow-up and was incidentally found to have an intrapapillary hemorrhage in her right eye as shown below (figure 1). Intrapapillary hemorrhages are more common near the nasal border of the nerve in myopic eyes with tilted discs, and may be spontaneous or precipitated by acute disc edema, valsalva maneuver, or vitreopapillary traction [1]. The patient in this scenario was not myopic, and underwent echography to rule our optic nerve drusen or a vascular tumor. It was later revealed that she had been coughing recently, possible leading to a valsalva maneuver. These hemorrhages generally have a good prognosis and resolve spontaneously [1,2]. Of note, this hemorrhage is different than the typical peripapillary hemorrhage seen in normal tension glaucoma, which is located on the border of the border of the optic disc (see Optic Disc Hemorrhage in Normal Tension Glaucoma)",

An optic nerve pit is a congenital defect thought to arise from incomplete closure of the embryonic fissure during development and appears as an oval gray-white or black depression. It is a very rare condition (estimated prevalence of 1 in 11,000), bilateral in 15% cases, and equally prevalent in men and women. Figure 1",

      "description": "Updated: August 18, 2025; Original: September 9, 2013 Myelination of the optic nerve fibers normally begins at the lateral geniculate body and ceases at the lamina cribosa. However, in some individuals areas of the retinal nerve fiber layer can also become myelinated. Classically, this finding is unilateral and peripapillary in location, appearing as a white, flame-shaped area with feathered borders as seen in the top photo. However, it can also present bilaterally in 7% of these patients as illustrated in the middle photo.(1) The bottom photo shows a less common presentation affecting a more extensive distribution of the peripheral nerve fibers. Note how the nerve fibers temporal to the macula respect the horizontal raphe, a concept not easily visualized under normal conditions",
