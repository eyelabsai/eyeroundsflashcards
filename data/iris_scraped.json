      "description": "Iridencleisis is a historic glaucoma filtering surgery that is no longer used. It is a free-filtering procedure that creates a full-thickness fistula between the anterior chamber and the subconjunctival space through an anterior sclerostomy. This procedure is unique in that it involves entrapping a pillar of iris tissue into the sclerostomy to act as a wick to hold the sclerostomy open. This procedure was abandoned in part due to the theoretical risk of sympathetic ophthalmia development in an eye with incarcerated uveal tissue. In this patient note the superior sector iridectomy (unfortunately already dilated) and pigment visible in the superior bleb. Gonioscopy shows iris tissue incarcerated in the sclerostomy with visible ciliary processes posterior to this",

Clinically, melanocytomas most often present as asymptomatic pigmented lesions. Melanocytomas can occur anywhere along the uveal tract, but are most commonly found in the juxtapapillary region of the choroid (see related links). Traditionally viewed as benign lesions, transformation into a malignant melanoma can occur. Malignant transformation rates for choroidal melanocytomas have been reported at 2%.(1) Fig 1A: Slit lamp examination, demonstrates a dark brown, pigmented lesion in the peripheral iris extending from 6:30 to 8 o'clock",

A patent iridotomy allows aqueous humor from the posterior chamber to reach the anterior chamber, bypassing any potential pupillary block and preventing the iris from billowing forward and occluding the trabecular meshwork. The iridotomy should be positioned as peripheral as possible to decrease the risk of posterior synechiae or cataract, but not so far peripheral that one is unable to confirm its patency. Patency is best confirmed by direct visualization as opposed to transillumination, because even non-patent iridotomies can transilluminate. LPIs have traditionally been placed superiorly, under the upper eyelid, to decrease the risk of post-operative dysphotopsias. However, in our experience, LPIs placed temporally are much less likely to result in these visual disturbances",

This 34-year-old African American male might appear to have severe thinning of the temporal neuroretinal rim, but if the examiner traces the margin of the optic disc carefully and realizes there is a gray crescent, he will appreciate the rim of healthy optic nerve tissue temporally.

The appearance of the NVI in this patient is subtle as he has undergone intravitreal injections of bevacizumab for neovascular glaucoma. Although much less common than in central retinal vein occlusions, the incidence of NVI has been shown to be about 10.9% after a CRAO.

      "description": "Posted: 12/09/2024 A 74-year-old female with history of proliferative diabetic retinopathy in both eyes (OU), lamellar hole in the left eye (OS), POAG status post Ahmed tube in the right eye (OD), full thickness macular hole OD status post vitrectomy, and cataract extraction with implantation of AMO 9002, 3-piece silicone intraocular lenses OU 15 years ago was referred for a several month history of blurry and decreased vision OS. She had already undergone YAG-laser capsulotomy OS by an outside provider without improvement in her visual acuity. On presentation, her vision was 20/200 OS. Her exam was notable for granular, white deposits on the posterior surface of the lens OS. She had already undergone explantation of the OD silicone lens for a similar process. She was consented for intraocular lens exchange OS with a MA50BM lens",
