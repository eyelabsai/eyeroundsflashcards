      "title": "Dacryocystitis Associated with Lacrimal Sac Dacryolith",
      "description": "A 51-year-old woman presented with chronic dacryocystitis secondary to obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct (NLD). Her symptoms included persistent tearing and difficulty with vision due to discharge. Examination showed purulent drainage along the right medial canthus, overlying erythema, and pain upon palpitation (Figure 1). The patient subsequently underwent endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy and a large dacryolith (Figure 2) was removed from the lacrimal sac. The patient had complete resolution of symptoms one week after surgery (Figure 3). Composed of devitalized epithelial cells and calcified amorphous debris, Dacryoliths often lead to lacrimal sac distension and potential obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct [1]",

      "description": "Lacrimal gland dacryops are benign ductal cysts. It was originally suggested that they form secondary to ductal occlusion and subsequent build-up of secretions, but this has not been supported experimentally. It has been hypothesized more recently that some may form secondary to chronic inflammation of the lacrimal gland causing secondary immune response by the conjunctiva-associated lymphoid system with oversecretion of IgA and resulting osmotic effect with cyst formation. In this photograph, the cystic structure can be visualized lateral to the globe when the lids are retracted. The CT scan reveals a cystic structure in the region of the lacrimal gland without bony disruption. In this photograph, the cystic structure can be visualized lateral to the globe when the lids are retracted",

Her symptoms included persistent tearing and difficulty with vision due to discharge. Examination showed purulent drainage along the right medial canthus, overlying erythema, and pain upon palpitation (Figure 1). The patient subsequently underwent endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy and a large dacryolith (Figure 2) was removed from the lacrimal sac. The patient had complete resolution of symptoms one week after surgery (Figure 3). Composed of devitalized epithelial cells and calcified amorphous debris, Dacryoliths often lead to lacrimal sac distension and potential obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct [1]",

      "description": "A 62-year-old woman with a history of glaucoma and bilateral superior trabeculectomies presented with bilateral brow ptosis and right upper eyelid ptosis (Figure 1). The patient underwent bilateral brow ptosis repair by internal browpexy and right upper eyelid ptosis repair by external levator advancement (ELA). After unilateral upper eyelid ptosis repair, the patient developed contralateral ptosis (Figure 2) [2]. The reflexive descent of the contralateral upper eyelid after the unilateral raising of the ptotic eyelid is common and explained by Hering's Law. Surgical repair leads to decreased innervation to the bilateral levator palpebrae muscles, which are equally innervated [1]. The patient subsequently underwent a left upper eyelid ptosis repair by ELA",

Examination was remarkable for a restrictive strabismus, right upper and lower eyelid retraction, and right greater than left inferior chemosis. Additional imaging and serology testing confirmed the diagnosis of thyroid eye disease (TED). In the early presentation of thyroid eye disease, patients may experience chemosis, conjunctival injection, and eyelid swelling secondary to orbital congestion. For more information on TED, see the EyeRounds TED tutorial.
