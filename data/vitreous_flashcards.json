      "description": "APMPPE is one of the white dot syndromes that occurs in young healthy adults and similarly affects males and females. It is usually bilateral, although may be worse in one eye. APMPPE is generally a self-limited condition that requires no treatment and has a good prognosis. A 47-year-old female presents with a four day history of fluttering bright spots in the right eye. She denies a viral prodrome or headaches. Color fundus photo, right eye (OD): Multiple creamy yellow-white lesions throughout the macula",

      "description": "Pseudohypopyon is a relatively rare manifestation of leukemia. It occurs most often in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and may be seen during a blast crisis or as a sign of relapse [1]. Rapid development of an atypical, blood-stained hypopyon that fails to respond to corticosteroid therapy is classic for leukemic pseudohypopyon [2]. Pseudohypopyon is distinguished from infectious or inflammatory hypopyon by the absence of an associated fibrin reaction. This pseudohypopyon was the first sign of this 56-year-old patient's acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapse. Timely anterior chamber aspiration with cytology and systemic malignancy work-up are paramount to ensuring appropriate diagnosis and treatment",

      "title": "Central retinal vein occlusion with cilioretinal artery occlusion ",
      "description": "Cilioretinal artery occlusion (CLRAO) often occurs in the setting of a central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). This lack of perfusion in the cilioretinal artery results from a functional hemodynamic block as the low perfusion pressure of the choroid, which supplies the cilioretinal artery, is unable to overcome the elevated venous pressure which results from the CRVO. The central retinal artery, however, is still able to perfuse due to its baseline higher perfusion pressure and ability to autoregulate its intraluminal pressure. In this photo, there are diffusely scattered intraretinal hemorrhages and cotton wool spots with associated venous distention and tortuosity secondary to the CRVO. Note the area of retinal whitening extending from the temporal disc into the macula in the region perfused by the cilioretinal artery. The fluorescein angiogram confirms that this is a cilioretinal artery as it fills with the choroid, prior to the filling of the central retinal artery",

Additional findings include graying of the parafoveal retina, superficial crystalline deposits, subfoveal cavities, and right-angle vessels. Symptoms include blurred vision, metamorphopsia and paracentral scotomas. Fluorescein angiography will highlight the parafoveal telangiectatic vessels that show early hyperfluorescence with late leakage. OCT will show subfoveal cystoid spaces without cystoid macular edema. Fundus autofluorescence is very diagnostic in that the normal hypoautofluorescence at the fovea is lost and will show abnormally increased foveal autofluorescence",

Due to its density, low viscosity, and immiscibility in water, the PFO is able to displace sub-retinal fluid and blood anteriorly, allowing for retinal unfolding and stabilization during repair. PFO has been observed to be safe and effective in the management of retinal detachments. Possible complications include increased intraocular pressure, hypotony, decreased visual acuity, retained PFO, need for re-operation, and cataract formation. However, complication rates after the use of PFO were shown to be comparable to other intraoperative retinal attachment management options",

Other associated findings can include enlongated ciliary processes, prominent radial vessels or neovascularization on the iris surface, shallow anterior chamber with narrow-angle glaucoma, vitreous hemorrhage, and retinal detachment.

The lesions are flat, sharply circumscribed, placoid, chalky white, and lie at the level of the RPE.

There was a history of remote ocular trauma to this eye while grinding metal 3 years prior. There was no evidence of heterochromia but there was mild pigment dusting on the lens that was rust colored and consistent with siderosis. The IOFB is not visible in the fundus photograph, but is seen as a hyperechoic mass opposite the retinal detachment on the B-scan ultrasound. The IOFB was removed with a rare earth magnet via pars plana approach. The retina was re-attached with perfluoro-n-octane (PFO) liquid, endolaser, air-fluid exchange, and 18% perfluoropropane (C3F8) gas",

      "description": "A 20-year-old male was seen in the Retina Clinic for the possibility of retinitis pigmentosa, both eyes. Unrelated to this, the peripheral exam showed relatively symmetric white patches of retina inferiorly and inferotemporally that were visible without scleral indentation. Scleral depressed exam revealed that the retina was attached, and that there was no other peripheral retinal pathology. The vision and remainder of the exam was otherwise unremarkable. The exact cause of WWP is unknown. There has been controversy regarding its anatomical location, associated pathology, and its potential association with the development of retinal breaks",

      "description": "A 67-year-old man with history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and uncontrolled hypertension presented with a central visual field deficit of sudden onset in his right eye. Visual acuity on presentation was 20/25 in both eyes, and funduscopic examination revealed an isolated cilioretinal artery occlusion (CLRAO) in his right eye (Figure 1). Work-up revealed significant right internal carotid artery stenosis (>50%). A right carotid endarterectomy was performed, and vascular risk factors were optimized. Visual acuity was stable at 20/25 one month after presentation. CLRAO accounts for ~5-7% of retinal artery occlusions and is usually associated with a central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) or anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION)",

On the optical coherence tomogram below, there are parafoveal intraretinal cysts with exudates. Diabetic macular edema can result in diffuse or focal areas of swelling and retinal thickening and may be associated with hard exudates. Diabetic macular edema is often classified based on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS), which defined clinically significant diabetic macular edema. However, these findings are based on the funduscopic examination and in classifying this edema based on optical coherence tomography (OCT), the term center-involving macular edema is often used. Treatment includes the use of anti-VEGF drugs but may also include the use of focal or grid pattern photocoagulation or pars plana vitrectomy",

      "description": "Gunn's dots, originally described by Marcus Gunn, are tiny white dots sometimes visible overlying the large vessels near the optic nerve or the nerve fiber layers. Their presence depends on lighting conditions, and they have no pathologic significance. They are visible reflections of the internal limiting membrane, created by the footplate of the Muller cells. The tiny white specks in these photos are best visualized at the 12:00 and 6:00 positions approximately 1 disc diameter from the optic nerve head. A close up shot of the dots, superior to the optic disc, from the right eye",

Pseudohypopyon is distinguished from infectious or inflammatory hypopyon by the absence of an associated fibrin reaction. This pseudohypopyon was the first sign of this 56-year-old patient's acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapse.

They have a benign course and a slightly different clinical appearance (i.e. peripapillary heloicoidal choroidal atrophy). Pseudostreaks are unlikely to cause choroidal neovascularization, but may be associated with retinal telangiectasis",

Serous retinal detachment and suprachoroidal collection of serous fluid may be seen and confirmed with transillumination of the globe or ultrasonography. Other examination findings may include leopard-spotted changes in the retinal pigment epithelium (indicating chronicity), normal intraocular pressure (as opposed to hypotonous choroidal effusion), vitreous cell, dilation of episcleral blood vessels, and blood in Schlemm's canal. Due to the idiopathic nature, the diagnosis is made after excluding other causes of effusion such as inflammation or infection, neoplasm, or trauma.

      "description": "Posted: May 1, 2018 The patient presented with acute onset of blurry vision in both eyes associated with blood pressures exceeding 190/140 mmHg. On dilated exam, both eyes had a flame hemorrhage along the vascular arcade and shifting subretinal fluid in the macula. Acute systemic hypertension more commonly manifests as flame shaped hemorrhages in the nerve fiber layer, but serous retinal detachments have also been reported.[1,2]",

      "description": "Posted: 09/18/2024 A 15-year-old female with pars planitis, controlled for 2 years on adalimumab and methotrexate, presented for a new-onset superonasal visual field defect in the left eye. Fundus photography (A, B) showed inferior retinoschisis (yellow arrows) with associated retinal detachments (white arrows) in both eyes. B-scan of the right eye showed a double-layer sign (C). OCT in the left eye confirmed subretinal fluid into the macula. Due to a demarcation line, the right eye was cautiously observed, and the left eye underwent emergent retinal detachment repair.",

      "description": "Posted: 06/30/2025 Focal scleral nodules (previously called solitary idiopathic choroiditis or unifocal helioid choroiditis) are rare, amelanotic, intrascleral lesions localized to the posterior segment of the eye. They are often elevated and yellow or white in color. These lesions are typically asymptomatic and are incidentally found on dilated fundus exam. It is uncertain whether the lesions are congenital or the result of an old inflammatory process. In the case shown here, there was overlying retinal pigment epithelium disruption without subretinal fluid. If asymptomatic, these lesions are observed without intervention",

      "description": "A 62-year-old woman taking pentosan polysulfate (PPS) for interstitial cystitis (200 mg twice daily for 20 years; cumulative dose >2,500 g) underwent a baseline dilated exam. She reported several years of nyctalopia. Examination showed pigmentary retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) stippling with nummular macular atrophy extending toward the temporal optic disc margins (Figure 1). Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) demonstrated a speckled pattern of macular hyper- and hypoautofluorescence with peripapillary involvement (Figure 2). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed diffuse RPE excrescences and outer retinal atrophy (Figure 3). Findings were consistent with pentosan polysulfate (PPS)\u2013associated maculopathy",

      "description": "A 64-year-old woman was found on routine examination to have severe tortuosity of the superior arcade vessels in the right eye consistent with an arterial venous malformation (AVM). The other eye had moderately dilated and tortuous retinal vasculature. Retinal AVMs can be seen in isolation as an acquired anomaly or as an ophthalmic finding in Wyburn-Mason Syndrome, a rare congenital disorder characterized by AVMs in the retina and brain. Vision loss in AVMs may occur due to complications such as vascular occlusion. In this patient, MRI/MRA brain was negative for brain AVMs, and regular surveillance was advised.

      "description": "Updated: August 18, 2025; Original: September 9, 2013 Myelination of the optic nerve fibers normally begins at the lateral geniculate body and ceases at the lamina cribosa. However, in some individuals areas of the retinal nerve fiber layer can also become myelinated. Classically, this finding is unilateral and peripapillary in location, appearing as a white, flame-shaped area with feathered borders as seen in the top photo. However, it can also present bilaterally in 7% of these patients as illustrated in the middle photo.(1) The bottom photo shows a less common presentation affecting a more extensive distribution of the peripheral nerve fibers. Note how the nerve fibers temporal to the macula respect the horizontal raphe, a concept not easily visualized under normal conditions",
