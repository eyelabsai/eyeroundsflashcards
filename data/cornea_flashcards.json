      "description": "Acanthamoeba keratitis is a rare parasitic infection of the cornea that primarily occurs in contact lens wearers. The infection may be limited to the epithelium in its early stages, resulting in epithelial dendrites and punctate epitheliopathy. Later stromal involvement classically results in a partial or complete paracentral ring infiltrate, radial perineuritis, and pain out of proportion to the appearance on exam. Scleritis and uveitis may also be present. Figure 1: Corneal ring infiltrate in a patient with Acanthamoeba keratitis. The diagnosis was confirmed by confocal microscopy (Figure 3)",

This patient underwent Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) for Fuchs corneal endothelial dystrophy and cultures on the donor rim grew Candida albicans. Three months after the procedure, the patient was noted to have Candida growth within the interface between the graft and host tissue despite prophylactic anti-fungal therapy. The fungus was resistant to further medical therapy and recurred after repeat DSAEK and intracameral voriconazole. He subsequently required a penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) which successfully eradicated the infection.",

In the first photograph, the anterior chamber is 70% filled with SF6 gas and a superotemporal limbal suture can be seen. Anterior segment OCT verifies that the lenticule is in place and also shows the folds on the posterior corneal surface. After several days, the corneal edema eventually cleared and guttae were visible centrally in the graft tissue, consistent with Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy of the donor. These guttae are visible in the second photograph and this is likely the cause for delayed corneal clearing. Despite this, the patient still achieved 20/20 acuity",

During the surgery, a gas bubble is placed into the anterior chamber to press the graft against the posterior surface of the host cornea, resulting in adherence. Graft \"edge lift\" refers to non-adherence of peripheral areas of the graft. If the graft is oriented correctly with the endothelium facing toward the anterior chamber, it will roll, or scroll, toward the host corneal stroma. These photographs show an inferior edge lift of a DMEK graft, visible as a thin layer illuminated by the slit beam just deep to the corneal stroma with scrolling inferiorly. The anterior segment OCT shows another view of the edge lift",

In this condition, the centripetal pattern of cell migration from the corneal limbus becomes visible. The cells usually make a clockwise whorl or vortex pattern as they move centrally. It has been hypothesized by Dua that this is due to the effects of electromagnetic forces on the eye. This epitheliopathy typically disappears when epithelial turnover and migration slows to normal rates.",

      "description": "This is a 73-year-old male who presented initially for trabeculectomy surgery. Upon examination, the patient was found to have a corneal stromal scar with prominent ghost vessels. The patient was sent for blood work which returned positive for syphillis serologies. He was referred to infectious diseases and treated. He was having no acute symptoms further suggesting this was a chronic process. These lesions, when acute, present with neovascularization of the stroma, which some refer to as a salmon patch",

      "description": "This is a 51-year-old woman was referred to the ophthalmology clinic from otolaryngology with progressive blurred vision in the right eye after resection of large petroclival meningioma 1 month prior. She had lagopthalmos and incomplete blink with significantly decreased corneal sensation. She was found to have a corneal ulcer with a gray, heaped-up rim, surrounding white blood cell recruitment, and mild corneal edema. She was started on aggressive lubrication and topical antibiotics to prevent secondary bacterial infection with plan for future tarsorrhaphy. Round or oval-shaped ulcers with grayish, elevated edges are classic for neurotrophic ulcers. In this case the patient had a 5th cranial nerve palsy causing decreased sensation and was also predisposed to exposure given her 7th cranial nerve palsy",

PUK is usually unilateral and peripheral, due to the proximity to the conjunctival vasculature. There is typically an epithelial defect overlying the infiltrate and associated corneal stromal thinning or melting. The lesions will stain positively with fluorescein if there is an overlying epithelial defect.

      "description": "Tear breakup time (TBUT) is a clinical test used to assess for evaporative dry eye disease. To measure TBUT, fluorescein is instilled into the patient's tear film and the patient is asked not to blink while the tear film is observed under a broad beam of cobalt blue illumination. The TBUT is recorded as the number of seconds that elapse between the last blink and the appearance of the first dry spot in the tear film, as seen in this progression of these slit lamps photos over time. A TBUT under 10 seconds is considered abnormal. This patient also has punctate epithelial erosions (PEE) that stain positively with fluorescein, another sign of ocular surface dryness.",

These patients classically have a history of cyclical exacerbations and remissions with symptoms of foreign body sensation, photophobia, burning, tearing and occasionally blurring of vision. Symptoms are commonly bilateral but asymmetric. On exam, there are multiple slightly elevated corneal lesions which are round to oval conglomerates of gray, granular \"crumblike\" subepithelial opacities. These lesions normally negatively stain, but during exacerbations one can see staining with fluorescein dye",

The next day, her visual acuity was 20/70 and there was a moderate epithelial defect, but a large portion of previously opacified epithelium had completely cleared. We placed a bandage contact lens and treated her with topical antibiotic drops. At one week, her visual acuity had returned to baseline and her cornea appeared clear without stromal scarring",

The dense crystals seen within the deep stroma represent arborizing aggregates of an infectious agent, often alpha-hemolytic streptococcus or Candida albicans, and often originating from a suture track. Microbial colonies proliferate within stromal lamellar spaces and are shielded by a biofilm [1]. Corneal cultures are often negative",

Depending on the severity, anterior scleritis may be associated with ophthalmic complications including loss of visual acuity, anterior uveitis, peripheral ulcerative keratitis, glaucoma, and retinal or choroidal detachment, and frequently requires work-up for associated systemic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or, as in this case, relapsing polychondritis. Thus, it is important to differentiate it from benign or self-limiting episcleritis. On slit lamp exam, visible vessels have classically demonstrate a crisscrossing pattern with conjunctival vessels oriented radially and episcleral vessels oriented in a more circumferential pattern, and yield a characteristic \u201cviolaceous hue\u201d. Unlike conjunctival vessels, episcleral or deeper scleral vessels cannot be moved with a cotton-tipped applicator. Subconjunctival edema may be present",

He had a complicated left cataract surgery 45 years ago that resulted in subsequent ocular decompensation and scleromalacia, a degenerative thinning of sclera that allows visualization of the underlying pigmented uvea (Panels A-C). The scleromalacia led to anterior staphyloma, where the protrusion caused eyelid displacement (Panel D) so severe that it touched the lens of his glasses. Scleromalacia can be caused by other conditions including systemic connective tissue diseases (most commonly rheumatoid arthritis) and inflammatory processes such as vasculitis or infection; local trauma to the sclera may also be an inciting factor [1]. Loss of scleral connective tissue decreases the structural integrity of the globe; as such, scleromalacia confers an increased rupture risk with minor trauma. It is recommended that patients with this condition wear protective eyewear at all times",

Despite surgical intervention with drainage and anterior chamber washout, he had persistent, severe corneal blood staining. Corneal blood staining typically occurs in the presence of hyphema and increased intraocular pressure. \"",

On clinical examination, there were round stromal scars in the peripheral cornea consistent with her history of prior conductive keratoplasty (CK).

The peripheral round scars are well seen on retroillumination. \"",

She reported that the opacities had been present since age 12, with a slow, progressive worsening of her vision. On examination, visual acuity was 20/30 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. There were multifocal corneal opacities, predominantly consisting of anterior stromal breadcrumb opacities along with deeper posterior stromal lattice lines. Based on clinical findings, a diagnosis of granular type 2 corneal dystrophy was made.
