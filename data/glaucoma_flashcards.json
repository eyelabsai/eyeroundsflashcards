This procedure is unique in that it involves entrapping a pillar of iris tissue into the sclerostomy to act as a wick to hold the sclerostomy open. This procedure was abandoned in part due to the theoretical risk of sympathetic ophthalmia development in an eye with incarcerated uveal tissue. In this patient note the superior sector iridectomy (unfortunately already dilated) and pigment visible in the superior bleb.

Clinically, melanocytomas most often present as asymptomatic pigmented lesions. Melanocytomas can occur anywhere along the uveal tract, but are most commonly found in the juxtapapillary region of the choroid (see related links). Traditionally viewed as benign lesions, transformation into a malignant melanoma can occur. Malignant transformation rates for choroidal melanocytomas have been reported at 2%.(1) Fig 1A: Slit lamp examination, demonstrates a dark brown, pigmented lesion in the peripheral iris extending from 6:30 to 8 o'clock",

      "description": "This 87-year-old male has alongstanding history of primary open angle glaucoma. His optic nerve is significantly cupped with a marked number of optociliary shunt vessels. There are several drusen in the peripapillary region. Optociliary shunt vessels are collateral vessels connecting the choroidal and the retinal vasculature. The differential diagnosis for acquired optociliary shunt vessels commonly includes central retinal vein occlusion, chronic glaucoma, chronic papilledema, or an optic nerve sheath meningioma. Optociliary shunt vessels can be differentiated from neovascularization of the disc by their large caliber and lack of leakage on fluorescein angiogram",

A patent iridotomy allows aqueous humor from the posterior chamber to reach the anterior chamber, bypassing any potential pupillary block and preventing the iris from billowing forward and occluding the trabecular meshwork. The iridotomy should be positioned as peripheral as possible to decrease the risk of posterior synechiae or cataract, but not so far peripheral that one is unable to confirm its patency. Patency is best confirmed by direct visualization as opposed to transillumination, because even non-patent iridotomies can transilluminate. LPIs have traditionally been placed superiorly, under the upper eyelid, to decrease the risk of post-operative dysphotopsias. However, in our experience, LPIs placed temporally are much less likely to result in these visual disturbances",

Diagnosis is by clinical examination, computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography, and/or catheter angiography. A direct CCF (type a) connects the intracavernous portion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) to the sinus, whereas indirect, or dural, fistulas (type b) are low-flow fistulas that connect ICA branches to the cavernous sinus (1).

      "description": "Gray crescents of the optic nerve head are crescent-shaped areas of slate gray pigmentation in the substance of the peripheral optic nerve head. They are more common in African American patients, but are not associated with an increased risk of glaucoma. They are important to recognize and differentiate from peripapillary pigmentation, because failing to do so might lead one to misinterpret the width of the neuroretinal rim. This 34-year-old African American male might appear to have severe thinning of the temporal neuroretinal rim, but if the examiner traces the margin of the optic disc carefully and realizes there is a gray crescent, he will appreciate the rim of healthy optic nerve tissue temporally. Optical coherence tomography revealed normal thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer in all quadrants surrounding the optic nerve head.

      "description": "A 62-year-old female with primary open angle glaucoma was seen in the glaucoma clinic for follow-up and was incidentally found to have an intrapapillary hemorrhage in her right eye as shown below (figure 1). Intrapapillary hemorrhages are more common near the nasal border of the nerve in myopic eyes with tilted discs, and may be spontaneous or precipitated by acute disc edema, valsalva maneuver, or vitreopapillary traction [1]. The patient in this scenario was not myopic, and underwent echography to rule our optic nerve drusen or a vascular tumor. It was later revealed that she had been coughing recently, possible leading to a valsalva maneuver. These hemorrhages generally have a good prognosis and resolve spontaneously [1,2]. Of note, this hemorrhage is different than the typical peripapillary hemorrhage seen in normal tension glaucoma, which is located on the border of the border of the optic disc (see Optic Disc Hemorrhage in Normal Tension Glaucoma)",

      "description": "A 63-year-old man presented to the ophthalmology clinic for evaluation of a blind painful left eye. He had a complicated left cataract surgery 45 years ago that resulted in subsequent ocular decompensation and scleromalacia, a degenerative thinning of sclera that allows visualization of the underlying pigmented uvea (Panels A-C). The scleromalacia led to anterior staphyloma, where the protrusion caused eyelid displacement (Panel D) so severe that it touched the lens of his glasses. Scleromalacia can be caused by other conditions including systemic connective tissue diseases (most commonly rheumatoid arthritis) and inflammatory processes such as vasculitis or infection; local trauma to the sclera may also be an inciting factor [1]. Loss of scleral connective tissue decreases the structural integrity of the globe; as such, scleromalacia confers an increased rupture risk with minor trauma. It is recommended that patients with this condition wear protective eyewear at all times",

      "description": "This patient initially presented with neovascularization of the iris (NVI), or rubeosis iridis, and neovascular glaucoma (NVG) that occurred three months after a central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). The appearance of the NVI in this patient is subtle as he has undergone intravitreal injections of bevacizumab for neovascular glaucoma. Although much less common than in central retinal vein occlusions, the incidence of NVI has been shown to be about 10.9% after a CRAO. Figure 1: Anterior segment color photography with diffuse illumination of the right eye shows NVI as demonstrated by the fine, lacy blood vessels surrounding the pupillary margin. A slightly enhanced view of the NVI is shown within the white circle",
