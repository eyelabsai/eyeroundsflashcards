APMPPE is generally a self-limited condition that requires no treatment and has a good prognosis. A 47-year-old female presents with a four day history of fluttering bright spots in the right eye. She denies a viral prodrome or headaches. Color fundus photo, right eye (OD): Multiple creamy yellow-white lesions throughout the macula",

It occurs most often in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and may be seen during a blast crisis or as a sign of relapse [1]. Rapid development of an atypical, blood-stained hypopyon that fails to respond to corticosteroid therapy is classic for leukemic pseudohypopyon [2]. Pseudohypopyon is distinguished from infectious or inflammatory hypopyon by the absence of an associated fibrin reaction. This pseudohypopyon was the first sign of this 56-year-old patient's acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapse. Timely anterior chamber aspiration with cytology and systemic malignancy work-up are paramount to ensuring appropriate diagnosis and treatment",

Pseudohypopyon is distinguished from infectious or inflammatory hypopyon by the absence of an associated fibrin reaction. This pseudohypopyon was the first sign of this 56-year-old patient's acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapse.

Laboratory testing revealed an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) level of 294 U/L (normal 8-52). He was referred to pulmonary medicine and diagnosed with sarcoidosis.

      "description": "Uveal effusion syndrome is a rare entity involving the idiopathic collection of serous fluid in the suprachoroidal space. The condition is more common in middle-aged men. Serous retinal detachment and suprachoroidal collection of serous fluid may be seen and confirmed with transillumination of the globe or ultrasonography. Other examination findings may include leopard-spotted changes in the retinal pigment epithelium (indicating chronicity), normal intraocular pressure (as opposed to hypotonous choroidal effusion), vitreous cell, dilation of episcleral blood vessels, and blood in Schlemm's canal. Due to the idiopathic nature, the diagnosis is made after excluding other causes of effusion such as inflammation or infection, neoplasm, or trauma. Effective treatment often involves sclerotomy, quadrantic sclerectomy, and/or decompression of vortex veins",

He had underlying diabetes mellitus with known non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy but was otherwise immunocompetent. On dilated fundus examination there was moderate vitritis with sheet like patches of homogeneous peripheral whitening anterior to the equator, consistent with acute retinal necrosis (ARN). There is no visible vitreous traction or retinal tear or detachment. There is also vascular sheathing predominantly of the arterioles, which favors an underlying etiology of varicella zoster virus as the cause of ARN.",
