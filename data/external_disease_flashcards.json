      "description": "Posted: April 16, 2024 Hemangiomas are common developmental vascular malformations. Histologically they are composed of lobules of capillary sized venous channels. (1) While almost exclusively benign when appearing early in life, the clinician must have increased suspicious when a patient over 60 presents with a new capillary hemangioma of the conjunctiva. Some studies have shown a malignancy rate of 60% for new capillary hemangiomas appearing after 60 years of age. (2) For cosmetically bothersome benign lesions, topical beta blockers such as timolol are well tolerated and effective for shrinking the lesion.",

The lesion measured approximately 1 cm \u00d7 6.5 mm, with notable elevation and a melanotic core. The lesion had been slowly enlarging over six years. Her visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes (OU), with no reported diplopia, and intraocular pressures were within normal limits. Surgical excision was performed, and histopathology confirmed a juvenile compound nevus",
