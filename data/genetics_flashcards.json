      "title": "Acute Macular Neuroretinopathy (AMN)",
      "description": "Acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN) is a rare disease of unknown etiology that most commonly affects young to middle-aged females. The patient typically presents with the acute-onset of one or multiple paracentral scotomas that affect one or both eyes. This is typically the only symptom and visual acuity is unaffected. Fundus findings include 1 or more reddish-brown petalloid perifoveal lesions with the tip pointed toward the fovea that become visible days to months after the onset of symptoms. Lesions are typically better identified with infrared imaging. OCT through the lesions commonly show disruption of the inner segment/outer segment (IS/OS) junction (ellipsoid zone)",

It occurs most often in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and may be seen during a blast crisis or as a sign of relapse [1]. Rapid development of an atypical, blood-stained hypopyon that fails to respond to corticosteroid therapy is classic for leukemic pseudohypopyon [2]. Pseudohypopyon is distinguished from infectious or inflammatory hypopyon by the absence of an associated fibrin reaction. This pseudohypopyon was the first sign of this 56-year-old patient's acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapse. Timely anterior chamber aspiration with cytology and systemic malignancy work-up are paramount to ensuring appropriate diagnosis and treatment",

      "description": "Female carriers of X-linked recessive eye diseases may show variable expression of the disorders depending on the timing of X-inactivation. Patients with late X-inactivation have widely dispersed affected cells intermixed with unaffected cells, sometimes producing a characteristic tapetal reflex or \"metallic sheen\" as seen in this photograph. This patient is an asymptomatic carrier of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa who has two affected sons. Right Eye",

      "description": "X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS) is an X-linked recessive condition caused by a mutation in the RS1 gene. It results in splitting of the foveal and sometimes peripheral neurosensory retina. Clinically, this appears as cystic spaces and radial striae in the central macula, as seen in these photographs. The splitting is even more apparent on OCT. Over time, patients with XLRS develop decreased acuity with a central scotoma as seen in these Goldmann visual fields.",
