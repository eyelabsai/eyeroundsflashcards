      "description": "Anterior subcapsular cataracts (ASC) form after anterior lens epithelial cells become necrotic from a variety of causes including iritis, keratitis, inflammation associated with atopic dermatitis, irradiation, or electrical burns. The opacification of the lens is due to a migration of adjacent epithelial cells into the damaged area and subsequent transformation of these cells into a plaque of multiple layers of myofibroblasts. The most posterior layer of these cells remain epithelial cells and will produce a new lens capsule. Over time the myofibroblasts resolve leaving a wrinkled appearance to the lens capsule. A duplication cataract occurs when a cortical cataract develops in the same area as the ASC.",

On exam, she was noted to have granular lenticular opacities adjacent to the posterior capsule of the natural crystalline lens in the right eye. A diagnosis of posterior subcapsular cataract (PSC) was made. Factors such as diabetes mellitus, chlorpromazine use, or corticosteroids increase the risk of PSC formation. [1] In comparison to other cataract types, glare and decreased near acuity may be more common presenting symptoms. These types of cataracts are best viewed with slit lamp biomicroscopy retroillumination; care should be taken to achieve line of focus on the posterior capsule, or the cataract can be readily missed",

Silicone oil on an IOL is seen as variable sized droplets that are adherent to the surface of the IOL. These can be visually significant to varying degrees based on size and location of the droplets. The picture represents a patient who underwent cataract surgery with placement of a 3-piece silicone IOL about 3 years prior to presenting with a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment requiring pars plana vitrectomy with silicone oil placement and scleral buckle. He later presented with this large silicone oil droplet adherent to the posterior surface of his IOL. He went on to have an IOL exchange with silicone oil removal",

On exam, there was a retained lens fragment in the anterior chamber. Small pieces of nuclear or cortical lens material can sometimes be hidden in the ciliary sulcus at the end of cataract surgery. Patients present with an inflammatory picture. Often times cortical material can be observed and treated medically with anti-inflammatory topical treatment. Nuclear material, as in this case, however, often requires surgical intervention with removal of the lenticular remnant",

      "description": "Anterior subcapsular cataracts (ASC) form after anterior lens epithelial cells become necrotic from a variety of causes including iritis, keratitis, inflammation associated with atopic dermatitis, irradiation, or electrical burns. The opacification of the lens is due to a migration of adjacent epithelial cells into the damaged area and subsequent transformation of these cells into a plaque of multiple layers of myofibroblasts. The most posterior layer of these cells remain epithelial cells and will produce a new lens capsule. Over time the myofibroblasts resolve leaving a wrinkled appearance to the lens capsule. A duplication cataract occurs when a cortical cataract develops in the same area as the ASC.",

If the patient is a contact lens wearer, as in this image, the surface integrity of the contact lens can be compromised resulting in increased risk of infection as bacteria more easily bond to a disrupted surface. It can also decrease comfort of the lens and cause irritation of the palpebral conjunctiva as blinking causes the conjunctiva to rub across the roughened surface. The effect can heightened in a toric contact lens wearer since the rotational stabilization required for the toric optics prevents the lens from rotating and keeps the irritant rubbing on the same tissues. In addition to the contact lens complications, makeup can block the meibomian glands and exacerbate dry eye, the effect is worsened if the eyeliner used is waterproof.",

      "description": "Posterior polar cataracts are a form of congenital cataract commonly associated with posterior capsule changes. They can be autosomal dominant or sporadic and are more commonly bilateral. They are rarely visually significant and are usually stable, but may progress over time. This 42-year-old patient was referred from an outside provider with complaints of blurred vision at distance and near in addition to being bothered by glare. He had 2.5 mm concentric posterior polar opacities in both eyes and elected to undergo cataract extraction",

The lenses generally have a laser marking to aid the clinician in evaluating the fit. In the Comfilcon\u00ae lenses pictured, there is a single marking at 6 o'clock on the lens (seen as a bright linear reflection as light artifact reflects off the laser marking in the picture). If the marking is rotated away from the 6 o'clock position, as in the second image, more analysis is required. If the marking stabilizes in that location you can note it and move on if the vision is good. However, if the vision is not acceptable, you can compensate the axis using the LARS rule- Left Add, Right Subtract",

The picture represents a patient who underwent cataract surgery with placement of a 3-piece silicone IOL about 3 years prior to presenting with a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment requiring pars plana vitrectomy with silicone oil placement and scleral buckle.

      "description": "Posted: 06/26/2025 A 70-year-old man presented to the clinic 2 years after right-sided cataract extraction with a posterior chamber intra-ocular lens (PCIOL) implant performed at an outside hospital. He reported blurriness as well as seeing a \"half-moon shadow\" in his right eye vision. Slit lamp examination of his right eye showed inferonasal subluxation of his PCIOL along with 2+ posterior capsular opacification and cortical material within the capsular bag. He was taken to the OR for an IOL exchange procedure. Intra-operatively, a posterior capsular tear was encountered which was complicated by the IOL protruding out of the tear and vitreous prolapse. He underwent IOL explantation and anterior vitrectomy followed by placement of a new IOL in the sulcus with capture by the anterior capsule",

      "description": "TThis patient had residual corneal edema with prominent Descemet's membrane folds visible on the posterior corneal surface on her first postoperative day after undergoing Descemet's membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK). In the first photograph, the anterior chamber is 70% filled with SF6 gas and a superotemporal limbal suture can be seen. Anterior segment OCT verifies that the lenticule is in place and also shows the folds on the posterior corneal surface. After several days, the corneal edema eventually cleared and guttae were visible centrally in the graft tissue, consistent with Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy of the donor. These guttae are visible in the second photograph and this is likely the cause for delayed corneal clearing. Despite this, the patient still achieved 20/20 acuity",

Graft \"edge lift\" refers to non-adherence of peripheral areas of the graft. If the graft is oriented correctly with the endothelium facing toward the anterior chamber, it will roll, or scroll, toward the host corneal stroma.

When progressive or severe, the LASIK flap must be lifted and the epithelium scraped from the bed. Recurrent cases may require suturing of the LASIK flap. Figure 1",

      "description": "This patient was on chronic topical steroids after undergoing a deep lamellar endothelial keratoplasty (DLEK) when she developed Herpes simplex virus (HSV) epithelial keratitis. The dendritic ulcer is visible using the sclerotic scatter technique (top) and it becomes readily apparent with fluorescein staining (middle image). HSV dendritic ulcers have terminal bulbs and their base stains positively with fluorescein. They can coalesce to form larger geographic ulcers, as seen centrally here, especially in the presence of topical steroids. After resolution of the keratitis, residual subepithelial infiltration and scarring can be seen just deep to the area of the previous ulcer, resulting in \"ghost dendrites\", as seen in the bottom photo.",

In this condition, the centripetal pattern of cell migration from the corneal limbus becomes visible. The cells usually make a clockwise whorl or vortex pattern as they move centrally. It has been hypothesized by Dua that this is due to the effects of electromagnetic forces on the eye.

She had lagopthalmos and incomplete blink with significantly decreased corneal sensation. She was found to have a corneal ulcer with a gray, heaped-up rim, surrounding white blood cell recruitment, and mild corneal edema. She was started on aggressive lubrication and topical antibiotics to prevent secondary bacterial infection with plan for future tarsorrhaphy. Round or oval-shaped ulcers with grayish, elevated edges are classic for neurotrophic ulcers. In this case the patient had a 5th cranial nerve palsy causing decreased sensation and was also predisposed to exposure given her 7th cranial nerve palsy",

PUK is usually unilateral and peripheral, due to the proximity to the conjunctival vasculature. There is typically an epithelial defect overlying the infiltrate and associated corneal stromal thinning or melting. The lesions will stain positively with fluorescein if there is an overlying epithelial defect.

Elevated mucous plaques may occur weeks to months after resolution of the original pseudodendrites. Residual corneal hypoesthesia after the infection can be severe",

      "description": "Epithelial downgrowth is a rare complication of intraocular surgery or penetrating ocular trauma. Epithelial invasion into the anterior chamber occurs when non-keratinized epithelial cells migrate through a surgical or traumatic corneal wound. Once in the anterior chamber, epithelial cell migration may lead to corneal decompensation, recalcitrant glaucoma, and occasionally invade the posterior pole. Treatments are generally limited and when employed are often ineffective.

He had a remote history of open globe with multiple subsequent penetrating keratoplasties and a recent macula-involving retinal detachment all in the right eye with resulting hand motions vision. He was diagnosed with suture-related infectious crystalline keratopathy with associated epithelialized stromal melt. The dense crystals seen within the deep stroma represent arborizing aggregates of an infectious agent, often alpha-hemolytic streptococcus or Candida albicans, and often originating from a suture track. Microbial colonies proliferate within stromal lamellar spaces and are shielded by a biofilm [1]. Corneal cultures are often negative",

Depending on the severity, anterior scleritis may be associated with ophthalmic complications including loss of visual acuity, anterior uveitis, peripheral ulcerative keratitis, glaucoma, and retinal or choroidal detachment, and frequently requires work-up for associated systemic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or, as in this case, relapsing polychondritis. Thus, it is important to differentiate it from benign or self-limiting episcleritis. On slit lamp exam, visible vessels have classically demonstrate a crisscrossing pattern with conjunctival vessels oriented radially and episcleral vessels oriented in a more circumferential pattern, and yield a characteristic \u201cviolaceous hue\u201d. Unlike conjunctival vessels, episcleral or deeper scleral vessels cannot be moved with a cotton-tipped applicator. Subconjunctival edema may be present",

      "description": "A 63-year-old man presented to the ophthalmology clinic for evaluation of a blind painful left eye. He had a complicated left cataract surgery 45 years ago that resulted in subsequent ocular decompensation and scleromalacia, a degenerative thinning of sclera that allows visualization of the underlying pigmented uvea (Panels A-C). The scleromalacia led to anterior staphyloma, where the protrusion caused eyelid displacement (Panel D) so severe that it touched the lens of his glasses. Scleromalacia can be caused by other conditions including systemic connective tissue diseases (most commonly rheumatoid arthritis) and inflammatory processes such as vasculitis or infection; local trauma to the sclera may also be an inciting factor [1]. Loss of scleral connective tissue decreases the structural integrity of the globe; as such, scleromalacia confers an increased rupture risk with minor trauma. It is recommended that patients with this condition wear protective eyewear at all times",

The blood accumulates between the sclera and the conjunctiva and appears as a red spot on the white of the eye. The bleeding can be caused by trauma, hypertension, elevated venous pressure (e.g., Valsalva maneuver, coughing, vomiting), anticoagulant therapy, and acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis [1]. The most common risk factors in younger patients are trauma and contact lens usage [2]",

His ocular exam is notable for fine pigment deposition in the posterior corneal stroma and endothelium. In addition, there is pigmentation in a stellate pattern on the anterior lens and lens capsule. This rarely causes a decrease in visual acuity. These findings are characteristic of long-term thorazine use and are suspected to be related to dose and duration of treatment.

The patient typically presents with the acute-onset of one or multiple paracentral scotomas that affect one or both eyes. This is typically the only symptom and visual acuity is unaffected. Fundus findings include 1 or more reddish-brown petalloid perifoveal lesions with the tip pointed toward the fovea that become visible days to months after the onset of symptoms. Lesions are typically better identified with infrared imaging. OCT through the lesions commonly show disruption of the inner segment/outer segment (IS/OS) junction (ellipsoid zone)",

Rapid development of an atypical, blood-stained hypopyon that fails to respond to corticosteroid therapy is classic for leukemic pseudohypopyon [2]. Pseudohypopyon is distinguished from infectious or inflammatory hypopyon by the absence of an associated fibrin reaction. This pseudohypopyon was the first sign of this 56-year-old patient's acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapse.

      "description": "This 7-year-old girl presented with decreased vision and nystagmus and was diagnosed with oculocutaneous albinism (OCA). OCA is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and is characterized by decreased melanin and subnormal vision since birth. Findings on exam include hypopigmentation of the skin, hair, and irides with diffuse iris transillumination defects on retroillumination, as seen in the photograph. Decreased acuity can be attributed to foveal hypoplasia which is apparent as an abnormally small or absent foveal depression as seen in this optical coherence tomography (OCT) render. Albinism can also be limited solely to the eyes in ocular albinism which most commonly has X-linked recessive inheritance. OMIM #203200 OMIM, additional",

Historically, visualization of the optic nerve head has been used to assess disease severity. The optic nerve head contains a cup which is delineated by the neuroretinal rim. Normal cup-disc ratios range from 0",

      "description": "A 37-year-old aphakic female presented with decreased vision one week after the placement of an Ahmed Seton OS. On examination the intraocular pressure was 7 mmHg and the anterior chamber was completely flat. Slit lamp exam revealed kissing choroidal effusions. She was treated by tying off the Ahmed tube as there was concern for development of suprachoroidal hemorrhage. The intraocular pressure quickly returned to pre-operative levels and the choroidals were gone on postoperative day number one. The irregular iris is due to pupilloplasty at the time of Ahmed seton for visually significant cholinergic-induced meiosis",

A patent iridotomy allows aqueous humor from the posterior chamber to reach the anterior chamber, bypassing any potential pupillary block and preventing the iris from billowing forward and occluding the trabecular meshwork. The iridotomy should be positioned as peripheral as possible to decrease the risk of posterior synechiae or cataract, but not so far peripheral that one is unable to confirm its patency. Patency is best confirmed by direct visualization as opposed to transillumination, because even non-patent iridotomies can transilluminate. LPIs have traditionally been placed superiorly, under the upper eyelid, to decrease the risk of post-operative dysphotopsias. However, in our experience, LPIs placed temporally are much less likely to result in these visual disturbances",

Diagnosis is by clinical examination, computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography, and/or catheter angiography. A direct CCF (type a) connects the intracavernous portion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) to the sinus, whereas indirect, or dural, fistulas (type b) are low-flow fistulas that connect ICA branches to the cavernous sinus (1).

      "description": "A 62-year-old female with primary open angle glaucoma was seen in the glaucoma clinic for follow-up and was incidentally found to have an intrapapillary hemorrhage in her right eye as shown below (figure 1). Intrapapillary hemorrhages are more common near the nasal border of the nerve in myopic eyes with tilted discs, and may be spontaneous or precipitated by acute disc edema, valsalva maneuver, or vitreopapillary traction [1]. The patient in this scenario was not myopic, and underwent echography to rule our optic nerve drusen or a vascular tumor. It was later revealed that she had been coughing recently, possible leading to a valsalva maneuver. These hemorrhages generally have a good prognosis and resolve spontaneously [1,2]. Of note, this hemorrhage is different than the typical peripapillary hemorrhage seen in normal tension glaucoma, which is located on the border of the border of the optic disc (see Optic Disc Hemorrhage in Normal Tension Glaucoma)",

The pressure in the posterior chamber rises, resulting in anterior bowing of the peripheral iris and obstruction of the trabecular meshwork.

Also note in this photograph a Seton tube inferiorly that is occluded by the iris bowing forward and the iris contacting the corneal endothelium peripherally.",

      "description": "A 63-year-old man presented to the ophthalmology clinic for evaluation of a blind painful left eye. He had a complicated left cataract surgery 45 years ago that resulted in subsequent ocular decompensation and scleromalacia, a degenerative thinning of sclera that allows visualization of the underlying pigmented uvea (Panels A-C). The scleromalacia led to anterior staphyloma, where the protrusion caused eyelid displacement (Panel D) so severe that it touched the lens of his glasses. Scleromalacia can be caused by other conditions including systemic connective tissue diseases (most commonly rheumatoid arthritis) and inflammatory processes such as vasculitis or infection; local trauma to the sclera may also be an inciting factor [1]. Loss of scleral connective tissue decreases the structural integrity of the globe; as such, scleromalacia confers an increased rupture risk with minor trauma. It is recommended that patients with this condition wear protective eyewear at all times",

She was found to have a platelet count of 0 and a small concomitant intracranial hemorrhage, though the latter was thought to be noncontributory to her retinal findings. Fundus photos demonstrate superficial, intraretinal, and subretinal involvement, including flame hemorrhage that indicate involvement of the sub-ILM layer, as well as disc hemorrhage. She unfortunately was lost to follow-up, but per her Hematology clinic notes, her visual symptoms have improved after receiving IVIG, Decadron, and Rituxan infusions. Treatment for her ITP is ongoing. Despite ITP being a disease of impaired coagulability, retinal hemorrhage is exceptionally rare",

In additional to the many small hemangiomas that were previously treated, she had a large superotemporal hemangioma that was treated more than 10 years prior with cryotherapy and photocoagulation. On follow up, she is found to have a moderately sized hemangioma just inferior to the largest previously treated lesion. There is a second, early hemangioma superonasal to the large chorioretinal scar seen on the montage photo. Capillary hemangiomas in the peripheral retina can often be observed as they are known to spontaneously regress or remain stable for years. Commonly used treatment modalities include argon laser photocoagulation, cryotherapy, and photodynamic therapy",

Clinically, melanocytomas most often present as asymptomatic pigmented lesions. Melanocytomas can occur anywhere along the uveal tract, but are most commonly found in the juxtapapillary region of the choroid (see related links). Traditionally viewed as benign lesions, transformation into a malignant melanoma can occur. Malignant transformation rates for choroidal melanocytomas have been reported at 2%.(1) Fig 1A: Slit lamp examination, demonstrates a dark brown, pigmented lesion in the peripheral iris extending from 6:30 to 8 o'clock",

A patent iridotomy allows aqueous humor from the posterior chamber to reach the anterior chamber, bypassing any potential pupillary block and preventing the iris from billowing forward and occluding the trabecular meshwork. The iridotomy should be positioned as peripheral as possible to decrease the risk of posterior synechiae or cataract, but not so far peripheral that one is unable to confirm its patency. Patency is best confirmed by direct visualization as opposed to transillumination, because even non-patent iridotomies can transilluminate. LPIs have traditionally been placed superiorly, under the upper eyelid, to decrease the risk of post-operative dysphotopsias. However, in our experience, LPIs placed temporally are much less likely to result in these visual disturbances",

They are more common in African American patients, but are not associated with an increased risk of glaucoma. They are important to recognize and differentiate from peripapillary pigmentation, because failing to do so might lead one to misinterpret the width of the neuroretinal rim. This 34-year-old African American male might appear to have severe thinning of the temporal neuroretinal rim, but if the examiner traces the margin of the optic disc carefully and realizes there is a gray crescent, he will appreciate the rim of healthy optic nerve tissue temporally. Optical coherence tomography revealed normal thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer in all quadrants surrounding the optic nerve head.

The appearance of the NVI in this patient is subtle as he has undergone intravitreal injections of bevacizumab for neovascular glaucoma. Although much less common than in central retinal vein occlusions, the incidence of NVI has been shown to be about 10.9% after a CRAO.

She had already undergone YAG-laser capsulotomy OS by an outside provider without improvement in her visual acuity. On presentation, her vision was 20/200 OS. Her exam was notable for granular, white deposits on the posterior surface of the lens OS. She had already undergone explantation of the OD silicone lens for a similar process. She was consented for intraocular lens exchange OS with a MA50BM lens",

This patient had a globe rupture in the setting of Terrien's Marginal degeneration and underwent a tectonic mini-PKP. Once a globe has been ruptured such as this, scleral lenses are extremely difficult to fit as they are typically designed with either oblate or prolate corneas in mind. With EyePrint Pro\u00ae, a mold of the eye is taken that is used to generate a 3-D computer model of the shape of the eye (centered on cornea, about 20 mm in diameter). To create a fully custom lens, the optics are overlayed and the desired corneal clearance is customized.",

In orthokeratology, typically a myopic eye is fitted with an rigid gas permeable lens that is very flat centrally, but has a reverse curve (steeper than the base curve) in the mid periphery. The lens then flattens and rearranges the corneal epithelium such that the shape of the anterior cornea changes from prolate to oblate.

The amount of space between the lens and the cornea is typically referred to as sag. Sagittal depth actually refers to the entire contact lens from the center of the lens to the plane that the edges circumscribe. Various brands of scleral contact lenses allow you to manipulate the sag in different ways in order to achieve the desired vault over the cornea. Some brands allow you to actually specify the sagittal depth where others require you to manipulate the base curve. A steeper base curve typically results in increased sagittal depth where a flatter base curve reduces it",

Intrapapillary hemorrhages are more common near the nasal border of the nerve in myopic eyes with tilted discs, and may be spontaneous or precipitated by acute disc edema, valsalva maneuver, or vitreopapillary traction [1]. The patient in this scenario was not myopic, and underwent echography to rule our optic nerve drusen or a vascular tumor. It was later revealed that she had been coughing recently, possible leading to a valsalva maneuver. These hemorrhages generally have a good prognosis and resolve spontaneously [1,2]. Of note, this hemorrhage is different than the typical peripapillary hemorrhage seen in normal tension glaucoma, which is located on the border of the border of the optic disc (see Optic Disc Hemorrhage in Normal Tension Glaucoma)",

      "description": "Updated: August 18, 2025; Original: September 9, 2013 Myelination of the optic nerve fibers normally begins at the lateral geniculate body and ceases at the lamina cribosa. However, in some individuals areas of the retinal nerve fiber layer can also become myelinated. Classically, this finding is unilateral and peripapillary in location, appearing as a white, flame-shaped area with feathered borders as seen in the top photo. However, it can also present bilaterally in 7% of these patients as illustrated in the middle photo.(1) The bottom photo shows a less common presentation affecting a more extensive distribution of the peripheral nerve fibers. Note how the nerve fibers temporal to the macula respect the horizontal raphe, a concept not easily visualized under normal conditions",

As this finding denotes persistent fetal vasculature, Bergmeister papilla are often found in individuals born prematurely. Though not present in this fundus photo, Bergmeister papilla can contain retinal vessels (i.e. prepapillary vascular loop), which in very rare instances can thrombose, leading to symptomatic vitreous hemorrhage, BRAO/BRVO, or hyphema. However, for the vast majority of individuals, this is an asymptomatic, incidental finding requiring no further workup",

      "description": "A 51-year-old woman presented with chronic dacryocystitis secondary to obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct (NLD). Her symptoms included persistent tearing and difficulty with vision due to discharge. Examination showed purulent drainage along the right medial canthus, overlying erythema, and pain upon palpitation (Figure 1). The patient subsequently underwent endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy and a large dacryolith (Figure 2) was removed from the lacrimal sac. The patient had complete resolution of symptoms one week after surgery (Figure 3). Composed of devitalized epithelial cells and calcified amorphous debris, Dacryoliths often lead to lacrimal sac distension and potential obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct [1]",

It has been hypothesized more recently that some may form secondary to chronic inflammation of the lacrimal gland causing secondary immune response by the conjunctiva-associated lymphoid system with oversecretion of IgA and resulting osmotic effect with cyst formation. In this photograph, the cystic structure can be visualized lateral to the globe when the lids are retracted. The CT scan reveals a cystic structure in the region of the lacrimal gland without bony disruption.

      "description": "A 51-year-old woman presented with chronic dacryocystitis secondary to obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct (NLD). Her symptoms included persistent tearing and difficulty with vision due to discharge. Examination showed purulent drainage along the right medial canthus, overlying erythema, and pain upon palpitation (Figure 1). The patient subsequently underwent endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy and a large dacryolith (Figure 2) was removed from the lacrimal sac. The patient had complete resolution of symptoms one week after surgery (Figure 3). Composed of devitalized epithelial cells and calcified amorphous debris, Dacryoliths often lead to lacrimal sac distension and potential obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct [1]",

The patient underwent bilateral brow ptosis repair by internal browpexy and right upper eyelid ptosis repair by external levator advancement (ELA). After unilateral upper eyelid ptosis repair, the patient developed contralateral ptosis (Figure 2) [2]. The reflexive descent of the contralateral upper eyelid after the unilateral raising of the ptotic eyelid is common and explained by Hering's Law. Surgical repair leads to decreased innervation to the bilateral levator palpebrae muscles, which are equally innervated [1]. The patient subsequently underwent a left upper eyelid ptosis repair by ELA",

      "description": "This 51-year-old man presented with acute onset of binocular diplopia, injected eyes, and periocular swelling that was initially diagnosed as episcleritis but worsened despite lubrication and topical steroids. Examination was remarkable for a restrictive strabismus, right upper and lower eyelid retraction, and right greater than left inferior chemosis. Additional imaging and serology testing confirmed the diagnosis of thyroid eye disease (TED). In the early presentation of thyroid eye disease, patients may experience chemosis, conjunctival injection, and eyelid swelling secondary to orbital congestion. For more information on TED, see the EyeRounds TED tutorial. Right eye : Minimal edema of right upper and lower eyelids, 4+ bullous chemosis from 0200 to 0930 with 2+ diffuse injection, mild inferotemporal thinning (dellen) at the limbus",

      "description": "Pseudohypopyon is a relatively rare manifestation of leukemia. It occurs most often in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and may be seen during a blast crisis or as a sign of relapse [1]. Rapid development of an atypical, blood-stained hypopyon that fails to respond to corticosteroid therapy is classic for leukemic pseudohypopyon [2]. Pseudohypopyon is distinguished from infectious or inflammatory hypopyon by the absence of an associated fibrin reaction. This pseudohypopyon was the first sign of this 56-year-old patient's acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapse. Timely anterior chamber aspiration with cytology and systemic malignancy work-up are paramount to ensuring appropriate diagnosis and treatment",

      "description": "Cilioretinal artery occlusion (CLRAO) often occurs in the setting of a central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). This lack of perfusion in the cilioretinal artery results from a functional hemodynamic block as the low perfusion pressure of the choroid, which supplies the cilioretinal artery, is unable to overcome the elevated venous pressure which results from the CRVO. The central retinal artery, however, is still able to perfuse due to its baseline higher perfusion pressure and ability to autoregulate its intraluminal pressure. In this photo, there are diffusely scattered intraretinal hemorrhages and cotton wool spots with associated venous distention and tortuosity secondary to the CRVO. Note the area of retinal whitening extending from the temporal disc into the macula in the region perfused by the cilioretinal artery. The fluorescein angiogram confirms that this is a cilioretinal artery as it fills with the choroid, prior to the filling of the central retinal artery",

These vessels represent either new vessel growth within the retina or remodeling of pre-existing vessels through endothelial cell proliferation stimulated by hypoxia bordering areas of capillary nonperfusion. IRMA is one of the defining features of severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy based on the \"4-2-1\" criteria from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) [1]. When compared to neovascularization (NV) in proliferative disease, IRMAs are slightly larger in caliber with a more broad arrangement and are always contained to the intraretinal layers. Conversely, NV tends to be much finer and delicate in caliber, and is sometimes more focal in location depending on its severity. In severe cases, NV tends to grow along the posterior hyaloid interface especially around the optic nerve (i",

Additional findings include graying of the parafoveal retina, superficial crystalline deposits, subfoveal cavities, and right-angle vessels. Symptoms include blurred vision, metamorphopsia and paracentral scotomas. Fluorescein angiography will highlight the parafoveal telangiectatic vessels that show early hyperfluorescence with late leakage. OCT will show subfoveal cystoid spaces without cystoid macular edema. Fundus autofluorescence is very diagnostic in that the normal hypoautofluorescence at the fovea is lost and will show abnormally increased foveal autofluorescence",

      "description": "A 37-year-old aphakic female presented with decreased vision one week after the placement of an Ahmed Seton OS. On examination the intraocular pressure was 7 mmHg and the anterior chamber was completely flat. Slit lamp exam revealed kissing choroidal effusions. She was treated by tying off the Ahmed tube as there was concern for development of suprachoroidal hemorrhage. The intraocular pressure quickly returned to pre-operative levels and the choroidals were gone on postoperative day number one. The irregular iris is due to pupilloplasty at the time of Ahmed seton for visually significant cholinergic-induced meiosis",

The differential diagnosis for acquired optociliary shunt vessels commonly includes central retinal vein occlusion, chronic glaucoma, chronic papilledema, or an optic nerve sheath meningioma.

Due to its density, low viscosity, and immiscibility in water, the PFO is able to displace sub-retinal fluid and blood anteriorly, allowing for retinal unfolding and stabilization during repair. PFO has been observed to be safe and effective in the management of retinal detachments. Possible complications include increased intraocular pressure, hypotony, decreased visual acuity, retained PFO, need for re-operation, and cataract formation. However, complication rates after the use of PFO were shown to be comparable to other intraoperative retinal attachment management options",

There was a history of remote ocular trauma to this eye while grinding metal 3 years prior. There was no evidence of heterochromia but there was mild pigment dusting on the lens that was rust colored and consistent with siderosis. The IOFB is not visible in the fundus photograph, but is seen as a hyperechoic mass opposite the retinal detachment on the B-scan ultrasound. The IOFB was removed with a rare earth magnet via pars plana approach.

The infection can have three primary presentations: 1) chronic endophthalmitis, 2) localized granuloma, and 3) peripheral granuloma. These photographs show a classic localized granuloma located over the optic nerve. Also shown are the appearance of the granuloma on B-scan echography and optical coherence tomography (OCT).

      "description": "A 67-year-old man with history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and uncontrolled hypertension presented with a central visual field deficit of sudden onset in his right eye. Visual acuity on presentation was 20/25 in both eyes, and funduscopic examination revealed an isolated cilioretinal artery occlusion (CLRAO) in his right eye (Figure 1). Work-up revealed significant right internal carotid artery stenosis (>50%). A right carotid endarterectomy was performed, and vascular risk factors were optimized. Visual acuity was stable at 20/25 one month after presentation. CLRAO accounts for ~5-7% of retinal artery occlusions and is usually associated with a central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) or anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION)",

On the optical coherence tomogram below, there are parafoveal intraretinal cysts with exudates. Diabetic macular edema can result in diffuse or focal areas of swelling and retinal thickening and may be associated with hard exudates. Diabetic macular edema is often classified based on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS), which defined clinically significant diabetic macular edema. However, these findings are based on the funduscopic examination and in classifying this edema based on optical coherence tomography (OCT), the term center-involving macular edema is often used. Treatment includes the use of anti-VEGF drugs but may also include the use of focal or grid pattern photocoagulation or pars plana vitrectomy",

Rapid development of an atypical, blood-stained hypopyon that fails to respond to corticosteroid therapy is classic for leukemic pseudohypopyon [2]. Pseudohypopyon is distinguished from infectious or inflammatory hypopyon by the absence of an associated fibrin reaction. This pseudohypopyon was the first sign of this 56-year-old patient's acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapse.

Patients may develop dilation, tortuosity, and beading of the retinal veins; vascular sheathing; cotton-wool spots; flame-shaped hemorrhages; Roth spots; sub-hyaloid and sub-internal limiting membrane hemorrhages. These changes are similar to those seen with severe anemia. A 60-year-old female was referred for bilateral retinal hemorrhages. She noticed blurry since two months prior when she hit her head. She said her right eye gradually improved, but the left eye remained poor",

      "description": "Perfluorocarbon liquids (PFCLs) are utilized intraoperatively in retinal detachment surgery. They have a high specific gravity and thus can be used to displace subretinal fluid and manipulate giant retinal tears. Incomplete removal can lead to retained PFCL in the subretinal space, vitreous cavity, or anterior chamber. Retained PFCL in the anterior chamber has been reported to cause inflammation, secondary glaucoma, and corneal toxicity. This 17-year-old male sustained an open globe injury at age 11, and subsequently underwent open globe repair, phacoemulsifcation with intraocular lens placement, and pars plana vitrectomy for tractional retinal detachment. Postoperatively, he was noted to have a large amount of PFCL in the anterior chamber",

Serous retinal detachment and suprachoroidal collection of serous fluid may be seen and confirmed with transillumination of the globe or ultrasonography. Other examination findings may include leopard-spotted changes in the retinal pigment epithelium (indicating chronicity), normal intraocular pressure (as opposed to hypotonous choroidal effusion), vitreous cell, dilation of episcleral blood vessels, and blood in Schlemm's canal. Due to the idiopathic nature, the diagnosis is made after excluding other causes of effusion such as inflammation or infection, neoplasm, or trauma. Effective treatment often involves sclerotomy, quadrantic sclerectomy, and/or decompression of vortex veins",

She was found to have a platelet count of 0 and a small concomitant intracranial hemorrhage, though the latter was thought to be noncontributory to her retinal findings. Fundus photos demonstrate superficial, intraretinal, and subretinal involvement, including flame hemorrhage that indicate involvement of the sub-ILM layer, as well as disc hemorrhage. She unfortunately was lost to follow-up, but per her Hematology clinic notes, her visual symptoms have improved after receiving IVIG, Decadron, and Rituxan infusions. Treatment for her ITP is ongoing. Despite ITP being a disease of impaired coagulability, retinal hemorrhage is exceptionally rare",

      "description": "Posted: 06/30/2025 Focal scleral nodules (previously called solitary idiopathic choroiditis or unifocal helioid choroiditis) are rare, amelanotic, intrascleral lesions localized to the posterior segment of the eye. They are often elevated and yellow or white in color. These lesions are typically asymptomatic and are incidentally found on dilated fundus exam. It is uncertain whether the lesions are congenital or the result of an old inflammatory process. In the case shown here, there was overlying retinal pigment epithelium disruption without subretinal fluid. If asymptomatic, these lesions are observed without intervention",

Examination showed pigmentary retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) stippling with nummular macular atrophy extending toward the temporal optic disc margins (Figure 1).

Vision loss in AVMs may occur due to complications such as vascular occlusion. In this patient, MRI/MRA brain was negative for brain AVMs, and regular surveillance was advised.

However, in some individuals areas of the retinal nerve fiber layer can also become myelinated. Classically, this finding is unilateral and peripapillary in location, appearing as a white, flame-shaped area with feathered borders as seen in the top photo. However, it can also present bilaterally in 7% of these patients as illustrated in the middle photo.(1) The bottom photo shows a less common presentation affecting a more extensive distribution of the peripheral nerve fibers. Note how the nerve fibers temporal to the macula respect the horizontal raphe, a concept not easily visualized under normal conditions",

The residual corneal changes can result in anisometropia and the main cause of vision loss after such an injury is anisometropic amblyopia. Descemet's membrane ruptures from forceps injury tend to be oriented vertically or obliquely, while those secondary to congenital glaucoma (Haab's striae) are most commonly horizontal.

      "description": "A woman in her 40s presented due to persistent redness and foreign body sensation several weeks after an ocular injury from a pellet gun. She was found to have a nasal subconjunctival metallic foreign body with scarring of the plica semilunaris (Figure 1). Dilated fundus exam showed mild vitreous hemorrhage and a nasal peripheral region of hypopigmented scarring as well as intra- and subretinal hemorrhage, consistent with chorioretinitis sclopetaria (Fgiure 2). Chorioretinitis sclopetaria is a full-thickness rupture and retraction of the retina and choroid due to blunt trauma from a high velocity projectile, often leaving visible bare sclera at the injury site. This patient\u2019s subconjunctival pellet was successfully surgically removed, and there was no evidence of scleral laceration or intraocular penetration. Ultra-widefield imaging on follow up 2 weeks later showed interval improvement in the intra- and subretinal hemorrhage with chorioretinal atrophy (Figure 3)",

      "description": "This is a 51-year-old female that presented with severe ocular pain and photophobia. She presented acutely and had evidence of mutton-fat keratic precipitates (KP) on exam. She was later diagnosed with sarcoidosis. KP are collections of inflammatory cells on the corneal endothelium. When these coalesce and become large with a yellowish color, they are described as mutton-fat KP. These are typically associated with granulomatous inflammation",

The lesions progress to deep, punched-out chorioretinal scars, often with surrounding hyperpigmentation. In contrast to some similar conditions, there is no associated vitritis. Fluorescein angiography shows early hyperfluorescence and late staining of the lesions, as seen in these photographs.

It occurs most often in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and may be seen during a blast crisis or as a sign of relapse [1]. Rapid development of an atypical, blood-stained hypopyon that fails to respond to corticosteroid therapy is classic for leukemic pseudohypopyon [2]. Pseudohypopyon is distinguished from infectious or inflammatory hypopyon by the absence of an associated fibrin reaction. This pseudohypopyon was the first sign of this 56-year-old patient's acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapse. Timely anterior chamber aspiration with cytology and systemic malignancy work-up are paramount to ensuring appropriate diagnosis and treatment",

      "title": "Uveal Effusion Syndrome",
      "description": "Uveal effusion syndrome is a rare entity involving the idiopathic collection of serous fluid in the suprachoroidal space. The condition is more common in middle-aged men. Serous retinal detachment and suprachoroidal collection of serous fluid may be seen and confirmed with transillumination of the globe or ultrasonography. Other examination findings may include leopard-spotted changes in the retinal pigment epithelium (indicating chronicity), normal intraocular pressure (as opposed to hypotonous choroidal effusion), vitreous cell, dilation of episcleral blood vessels, and blood in Schlemm's canal. Due to the idiopathic nature, the diagnosis is made after excluding other causes of effusion such as inflammation or infection, neoplasm, or trauma. Effective treatment often involves sclerotomy, quadrantic sclerectomy, and/or decompression of vortex veins",

He had underlying diabetes mellitus with known non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy but was otherwise immunocompetent. On dilated fundus examination there was moderate vitritis with sheet like patches of homogeneous peripheral whitening anterior to the equator, consistent with acute retinal necrosis (ARN). There is no visible vitreous traction or retinal tear or detachment. There is also vascular sheathing predominantly of the arterioles, which favors an underlying etiology of varicella zoster virus as the cause of ARN.",

Pseudohypopyon is distinguished from infectious or inflammatory hypopyon by the absence of an associated fibrin reaction. This pseudohypopyon was the first sign of this 56-year-old patient's acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapse.

      "description": "Cilioretinal artery occlusion (CLRAO) often occurs in the setting of a central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). This lack of perfusion in the cilioretinal artery results from a functional hemodynamic block as the low perfusion pressure of the choroid, which supplies the cilioretinal artery, is unable to overcome the elevated venous pressure which results from the CRVO. The central retinal artery, however, is still able to perfuse due to its baseline higher perfusion pressure and ability to autoregulate its intraluminal pressure. In this photo, there are diffusely scattered intraretinal hemorrhages and cotton wool spots with associated venous distention and tortuosity secondary to the CRVO. Note the area of retinal whitening extending from the temporal disc into the macula in the region perfused by the cilioretinal artery. The fluorescein angiogram confirms that this is a cilioretinal artery as it fills with the choroid, prior to the filling of the central retinal artery",

Additional findings include graying of the parafoveal retina, superficial crystalline deposits, subfoveal cavities, and right-angle vessels. Symptoms include blurred vision, metamorphopsia and paracentral scotomas. Fluorescein angiography will highlight the parafoveal telangiectatic vessels that show early hyperfluorescence with late leakage. OCT will show subfoveal cystoid spaces without cystoid macular edema. Fundus autofluorescence is very diagnostic in that the normal hypoautofluorescence at the fovea is lost and will show abnormally increased foveal autofluorescence",

      "description": "Perfluoro-n-octane (PFO) is a dense liquid (specific gravity of 1.76) that is used for the intraoperative management of retinal detachments. Due to its density, low viscosity, and immiscibility in water, the PFO is able to displace sub-retinal fluid and blood anteriorly, allowing for retinal unfolding and stabilization during repair. PFO has been observed to be safe and effective in the management of retinal detachments. Possible complications include increased intraocular pressure, hypotony, decreased visual acuity, retained PFO, need for re-operation, and cataract formation. However, complication rates after the use of PFO were shown to be comparable to other intraoperative retinal attachment management options",

      "description": "Persistent fetal vasculature (PFV), previously called persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV), is a congenital defect that results when the fetal hyaloid vasculature fails to regress. The condition is almost always unilateral and associated with microphthalmia. Variable degrees of vascular remnants may remain, ranging from an isolated retrolenticular membrane to a complete stalk connecting the optic nerve to the lens as in this case. Other associated findings can include enlongated ciliary processes, prominent radial vessels or neovascularization on the iris surface, shallow anterior chamber with narrow-angle glaucoma, vitreous hemorrhage, and retinal detachment. In this photograph, a stalk can be seen emanating from the optic disc into the vitreous with tenting of the surrounding retina and dragging of the macula. The associated cataract has been removed surgically",

Groups of the spots, as seen here, are commonly referred to as \"polar bear tracks\" due to their color and resemblance of animal footprints. It is believed that these spots may develop secondary to deposition of an abnormal white material in retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells rather than the usual darkly pigmented melanin. The lesions are flat, sharply circumscribed, placoid, chalky white, and lie at the level of the RPE. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrates a disruption of the highly-reflective signal from the ellipsoid zone in the region of the lesions, as indicated by the orange line on the scan.",

      "description": "A 67-year-old man with history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and uncontrolled hypertension presented with a central visual field deficit of sudden onset in his right eye. Visual acuity on presentation was 20/25 in both eyes, and funduscopic examination revealed an isolated cilioretinal artery occlusion (CLRAO) in his right eye (Figure 1). Work-up revealed significant right internal carotid artery stenosis (>50%). A right carotid endarterectomy was performed, and vascular risk factors were optimized. Visual acuity was stable at 20/25 one month after presentation. CLRAO accounts for ~5-7% of retinal artery occlusions and is usually associated with a central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) or anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION)",

On the optical coherence tomogram below, there are parafoveal intraretinal cysts with exudates. Diabetic macular edema can result in diffuse or focal areas of swelling and retinal thickening and may be associated with hard exudates. Diabetic macular edema is often classified based on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS), which defined clinically significant diabetic macular edema. However, these findings are based on the funduscopic examination and in classifying this edema based on optical coherence tomography (OCT), the term center-involving macular edema is often used. Treatment includes the use of anti-VEGF drugs but may also include the use of focal or grid pattern photocoagulation or pars plana vitrectomy",

Patients may develop dilation, tortuosity, and beading of the retinal veins; vascular sheathing; cotton-wool spots; flame-shaped hemorrhages; Roth spots; sub-hyaloid and sub-internal limiting membrane hemorrhages. These changes are similar to those seen with severe anemia. A 60-year-old female was referred for bilateral retinal hemorrhages. She noticed blurry since two months prior when she hit her head. She said her right eye gradually improved, but the left eye remained poor",

They have a high specific gravity and thus can be used to displace subretinal fluid and manipulate giant retinal tears. Incomplete removal can lead to retained PFCL in the subretinal space, vitreous cavity, or anterior chamber. Retained PFCL in the anterior chamber has been reported to cause inflammation, secondary glaucoma, and corneal toxicity. This 17-year-old male sustained an open globe injury at age 11, and subsequently underwent open globe repair, phacoemulsifcation with intraocular lens placement, and pars plana vitrectomy for tractional retinal detachment. Postoperatively, he was noted to have a large amount of PFCL in the anterior chamber",

Serous retinal detachment and suprachoroidal collection of serous fluid may be seen and confirmed with transillumination of the globe or ultrasonography. Other examination findings may include leopard-spotted changes in the retinal pigment epithelium (indicating chronicity), normal intraocular pressure (as opposed to hypotonous choroidal effusion), vitreous cell, dilation of episcleral blood vessels, and blood in Schlemm's canal. Due to the idiopathic nature, the diagnosis is made after excluding other causes of effusion such as inflammation or infection, neoplasm, or trauma.

      "description": "This is a 62-year-old man with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who had undergone autologous bone marrow transplantation and noted vision loss after a coughing episode while admitted for pancytopenia and pneumonia. The photo was taken 1 month after onset of symptoms and demonstrates hemorrhages in multiple layers of the retina, but most prominently beneath the internal limiting membrane as demonstrated by spectral domain OCT (distinct from sub-hyaloid or pre-retinal hemorrhage). At 1 month, the red cells had taken on a pale white color. Initial vision was 20/70 OD and 20/40 OS improving to 20/20 OD and stable at 20/40 OS 3 months after onset of symptoms with observation",

      "description": "This 21 year old male noted a significant unilateral decrease in vision two days after an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) roll-over accident in which he suffered head trauma and a fractured rib. Radiating superficial retinal ischemia is seen here with scattered blot hemorrhages and venous dilation in the right eye. His left eye was unaffected. True Purtscher's Retinopathy was originally described in cases of known head-trauma, but this clinical picture can also be seen in a variety of disease mechanisms including chest compression, long-bone fracture, acute pancreatitis, and connective tissue disorders amongst others.",

They are often elevated and yellow or white in color. These lesions are typically asymptomatic and are incidentally found on dilated fundus exam. It is uncertain whether the lesions are congenital or the result of an old inflammatory process. In the case shown here, there was overlying retinal pigment epithelium disruption without subretinal fluid. If asymptomatic, these lesions are observed without intervention",

Examination showed pigmentary retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) stippling with nummular macular atrophy extending toward the temporal optic disc margins (Figure 1). Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) demonstrated a speckled pattern of macular hyper- and hypoautofluorescence with peripapillary involvement (Figure 2).

The other eye had moderately dilated and tortuous retinal vasculature. Retinal AVMs can be seen in isolation as an acquired anomaly or as an ophthalmic finding in Wyburn-Mason Syndrome, a rare congenital disorder characterized by AVMs in the retina and brain. Vision loss in AVMs may occur due to complications such as vascular occlusion. In this patient, MRI/MRA brain was negative for brain AVMs, and regular surveillance was advised.

      "description": "Updated: August 18, 2025; Original: September 9, 2013 Myelination of the optic nerve fibers normally begins at the lateral geniculate body and ceases at the lamina cribosa. However, in some individuals areas of the retinal nerve fiber layer can also become myelinated. Classically, this finding is unilateral and peripapillary in location, appearing as a white, flame-shaped area with feathered borders as seen in the top photo. However, it can also present bilaterally in 7% of these patients as illustrated in the middle photo.(1) The bottom photo shows a less common presentation affecting a more extensive distribution of the peripheral nerve fibers. Note how the nerve fibers temporal to the macula respect the horizontal raphe, a concept not easily visualized under normal conditions",
