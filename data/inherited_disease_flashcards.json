On follow up, she is found to have a moderately sized hemangioma just inferior to the largest previously treated lesion. There is a second, early hemangioma superonasal to the large chorioretinal scar seen on the montage photo.

It results in pigmentary retinopathy (usually pigment mottling without bone-spicule-like pigmentation) with macular atrophy and vascular attenuation as seen in these photos. The syndrome can be associated with systemic findings including ulnar polydactyly, obesity, mild developmental delay, and hypogonadism. Right eye",

      "description": "Sorsby macular dystrophy is an autosomal dominant condition caused by a mutation in the TIMP3 gene. Patients with this condition typically maintain normal acuity until their 40's when they develop severe, bilateral choroidal neovascular membranes. The macular lesions later have a \"pseudo-inflammatory\" appearance with geographic atrophy and dense clumps of black pigmentation, as seen in these photographs. Right Eye",

      "description": "Usher syndrome is an autosomal recessive condition that results in retinitis pigmentosa with associated congenital hearing loss. There are three main types of Usher syndrome. Type 1 is associated with profound congenital sensorineural hearing loss and poor vestibular function, most commonly caused by mutation in the MYO7A gene. Type 2 results in mild congenital hearing loss with normal vestibular function and is most commonly caused by a mutation in the USH2A gene. Type 3 is rare and can have slowly progressive hearing loss. It is most commonly caused by a mutation in the USH3A gene",

An optic nerve pit is a congenital defect thought to arise from incomplete closure of the embryonic fissure during development and appears as an oval gray-white or black depression. It is a very rare condition (estimated prevalence of 1 in 11,000), bilateral in 15% cases, and equally prevalent in men and women. Figure 1",
