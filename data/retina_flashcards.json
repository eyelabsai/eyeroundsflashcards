      "title": "Acute Macular Neuroretinopathy (AMN)",
      "description": "Acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN) is a rare disease of unknown etiology that most commonly affects young to middle-aged females. The patient typically presents with the acute-onset of one or multiple paracentral scotomas that affect one or both eyes. This is typically the only symptom and visual acuity is unaffected. Fundus findings include 1 or more reddish-brown petalloid perifoveal lesions with the tip pointed toward the fovea that become visible days to months after the onset of symptoms. Lesions are typically better identified with infrared imaging. OCT through the lesions commonly show disruption of the inner segment/outer segment (IS/OS) junction (ellipsoid zone)",

      "description": "Cilioretinal artery occlusion (CLRAO) often occurs in the setting of a central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). This lack of perfusion in the cilioretinal artery results from a functional hemodynamic block as the low perfusion pressure of the choroid, which supplies the cilioretinal artery, is unable to overcome the elevated venous pressure which results from the CRVO. The central retinal artery, however, is still able to perfuse due to its baseline higher perfusion pressure and ability to autoregulate its intraluminal pressure. In this photo, there are diffusely scattered intraretinal hemorrhages and cotton wool spots with associated venous distention and tortuosity secondary to the CRVO. Note the area of retinal whitening extending from the temporal disc into the macula in the region perfused by the cilioretinal artery. The fluorescein angiogram confirms that this is a cilioretinal artery as it fills with the choroid, prior to the filling of the central retinal artery",

These vessels represent either new vessel growth within the retina or remodeling of pre-existing vessels through endothelial cell proliferation stimulated by hypoxia bordering areas of capillary nonperfusion. IRMA is one of the defining features of severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy based on the \"4-2-1\" criteria from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) [1]. When compared to neovascularization (NV) in proliferative disease, IRMAs are slightly larger in caliber with a more broad arrangement and are always contained to the intraretinal layers. Conversely, NV tends to be much finer and delicate in caliber, and is sometimes more focal in location depending on its severity. In severe cases, NV tends to grow along the posterior hyaloid interface especially around the optic nerve (i",

      "description": "Idiopathic juxtafoveal telangiectasia type II (aka macular telangiectasia) is a rare idiopathic condition that is characterized by telangiectatic vessels in the juxtafoveolar region, most commonly temporal to the fovea, of both eyes. Additional findings include graying of the parafoveal retina, superficial crystalline deposits, subfoveal cavities, and right-angle vessels. Symptoms include blurred vision, metamorphopsia and paracentral scotomas. Fluorescein angiography will highlight the parafoveal telangiectatic vessels that show early hyperfluorescence with late leakage. OCT will show subfoveal cystoid spaces without cystoid macular edema. Fundus autofluorescence is very diagnostic in that the normal hypoautofluorescence at the fovea is lost and will show abnormally increased foveal autofluorescence",

On examination the intraocular pressure was 7 mmHg and the anterior chamber was completely flat. Slit lamp exam revealed kissing choroidal effusions. She was treated by tying off the Ahmed tube as there was concern for development of suprachoroidal hemorrhage. The intraocular pressure quickly returned to pre-operative levels and the choroidals were gone on postoperative day number one. The irregular iris is due to pupilloplasty at the time of Ahmed seton for visually significant cholinergic-induced meiosis",

Due to its density, low viscosity, and immiscibility in water, the PFO is able to displace sub-retinal fluid and blood anteriorly, allowing for retinal unfolding and stabilization during repair. PFO has been observed to be safe and effective in the management of retinal detachments. Possible complications include increased intraocular pressure, hypotony, decreased visual acuity, retained PFO, need for re-operation, and cataract formation. However, complication rates after the use of PFO were shown to be comparable to other intraoperative retinal attachment management options",

The lesions progress to deep, punched-out chorioretinal scars, often with surrounding hyperpigmentation. In contrast to some similar conditions, there is no associated vitritis. Fluorescein angiography shows early hyperfluorescence and late staining of the lesions, as seen in these photographs.

      "description": "Congenital albinotic spots of the retinal pigmented epithelium (CASRPE) can be configured in solitary or grouped configurations. Groups of the spots, as seen here, are commonly referred to as \"polar bear tracks\" due to their color and resemblance of animal footprints. It is believed that these spots may develop secondary to deposition of an abnormal white material in retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells rather than the usual darkly pigmented melanin. The lesions are flat, sharply circumscribed, placoid, chalky white, and lie at the level of the RPE. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrates a disruption of the highly-reflective signal from the ellipsoid zone in the region of the lesions, as indicated by the orange line on the scan.",

There was a history of remote ocular trauma to this eye while grinding metal 3 years prior. There was no evidence of heterochromia but there was mild pigment dusting on the lens that was rust colored and consistent with siderosis. The IOFB is not visible in the fundus photograph, but is seen as a hyperechoic mass opposite the retinal detachment on the B-scan ultrasound. The IOFB was removed with a rare earth magnet via pars plana approach. The retina was re-attached with perfluoro-n-octane (PFO) liquid, endolaser, air-fluid exchange, and 18% perfluoropropane (C3F8) gas",

Visual acuity on presentation was 20/25 in both eyes, and funduscopic examination revealed an isolated cilioretinal artery occlusion (CLRAO) in his right eye (Figure 1). Work-up revealed significant right internal carotid artery stenosis (>50%). A right carotid endarterectomy was performed, and vascular risk factors were optimized. Visual acuity was stable at 20/25 one month after presentation. CLRAO accounts for ~5-7% of retinal artery occlusions and is usually associated with a central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) or anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION)",

On the optical coherence tomogram below, there are parafoveal intraretinal cysts with exudates. Diabetic macular edema can result in diffuse or focal areas of swelling and retinal thickening and may be associated with hard exudates. Diabetic macular edema is often classified based on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS), which defined clinically significant diabetic macular edema. However, these findings are based on the funduscopic examination and in classifying this edema based on optical coherence tomography (OCT), the term center-involving macular edema is often used. Treatment includes the use of anti-VEGF drugs but may also include the use of focal or grid pattern photocoagulation or pars plana vitrectomy",

Lattice degeneration is often bilateral and occurs in 6-10% of the general population and seen more commonly in myopic eyes. Although only a small percentage of patients with lattice degeneration will develop a detachment, lattice is found in 20-30% of eyes that present with a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.",

It occurs most often in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and may be seen during a blast crisis or as a sign of relapse [1]. Rapid development of an atypical, blood-stained hypopyon that fails to respond to corticosteroid therapy is classic for leukemic pseudohypopyon [2]. Pseudohypopyon is distinguished from infectious or inflammatory hypopyon by the absence of an associated fibrin reaction. This pseudohypopyon was the first sign of this 56-year-old patient's acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapse. Timely anterior chamber aspiration with cytology and systemic malignancy work-up are paramount to ensuring appropriate diagnosis and treatment",

They have a high specific gravity and thus can be used to displace subretinal fluid and manipulate giant retinal tears. Incomplete removal can lead to retained PFCL in the subretinal space, vitreous cavity, or anterior chamber. Retained PFCL in the anterior chamber has been reported to cause inflammation, secondary glaucoma, and corneal toxicity. This 17-year-old male sustained an open globe injury at age 11, and subsequently underwent open globe repair, phacoemulsifcation with intraocular lens placement, and pars plana vitrectomy for tractional retinal detachment. Postoperatively, he was noted to have a large amount of PFCL in the anterior chamber",

Serous retinal detachment and suprachoroidal collection of serous fluid may be seen and confirmed with transillumination of the globe or ultrasonography. Other examination findings may include leopard-spotted changes in the retinal pigment epithelium (indicating chronicity), normal intraocular pressure (as opposed to hypotonous choroidal effusion), vitreous cell, dilation of episcleral blood vessels, and blood in Schlemm's canal. Due to the idiopathic nature, the diagnosis is made after excluding other causes of effusion such as inflammation or infection, neoplasm, or trauma. Effective treatment often involves sclerotomy, quadrantic sclerectomy, and/or decompression of vortex veins",

Fundus photos demonstrate superficial, intraretinal, and subretinal involvement, including flame hemorrhage that indicate involvement of the sub-ILM layer, as well as disc hemorrhage. She unfortunately was lost to follow-up, but per her Hematology clinic notes, her visual symptoms have improved after receiving IVIG, Decadron, and Rituxan infusions. Treatment for her ITP is ongoing. Despite ITP being a disease of impaired coagulability, retinal hemorrhage is exceptionally rare",

      "description": "Updated: August 18, 2025; Original: September 9, 2013 Myelination of the optic nerve fibers normally begins at the lateral geniculate body and ceases at the lamina cribosa. However, in some individuals areas of the retinal nerve fiber layer can also become myelinated. Classically, this finding is unilateral and peripapillary in location, appearing as a white, flame-shaped area with feathered borders as seen in the top photo. However, it can also present bilaterally in 7% of these patients as illustrated in the middle photo.(1) The bottom photo shows a less common presentation affecting a more extensive distribution of the peripheral nerve fibers. Note how the nerve fibers temporal to the macula respect the horizontal raphe, a concept not easily visualized under normal conditions",
