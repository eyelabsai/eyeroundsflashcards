      "description": "Anterior subcapsular cataracts (ASC) form after anterior lens epithelial cells become necrotic from a variety of causes including iritis, keratitis, inflammation associated with atopic dermatitis, irradiation, or electrical burns. The opacification of the lens is due to a migration of adjacent epithelial cells into the damaged area and subsequent transformation of these cells into a plaque of multiple layers of myofibroblasts. The most posterior layer of these cells remain epithelial cells and will produce a new lens capsule. Over time the myofibroblasts resolve leaving a wrinkled appearance to the lens capsule. A duplication cataract occurs when a cortical cataract develops in the same area as the ASC.",

On exam, she was noted to have granular lenticular opacities adjacent to the posterior capsule of the natural crystalline lens in the right eye. A diagnosis of posterior subcapsular cataract (PSC) was made. Factors such as diabetes mellitus, chlorpromazine use, or corticosteroids increase the risk of PSC formation. [1] In comparison to other cataract types, glare and decreased near acuity may be more common presenting symptoms. These types of cataracts are best viewed with slit lamp biomicroscopy retroillumination; care should be taken to achieve line of focus on the posterior capsule, or the cataract can be readily missed",

Silicone oil on an IOL is seen as variable sized droplets that are adherent to the surface of the IOL. These can be visually significant to varying degrees based on size and location of the droplets. The picture represents a patient who underwent cataract surgery with placement of a 3-piece silicone IOL about 3 years prior to presenting with a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment requiring pars plana vitrectomy with silicone oil placement and scleral buckle. He later presented with this large silicone oil droplet adherent to the posterior surface of his IOL. He went on to have an IOL exchange with silicone oil removal",

On exam, there were thick posterior capsular opacities with a capsular block appearance and fluid noted beyond the intraocular lens.",

      "description": "Posted: 06/27/2024 A 64-year-old man with a history of bilateral pseudophakia and partial-thickness corneal transplantation in both eyes presented for progressive vision loss in the left eye. The patient underwent uncomplicated cataract surgery several years ago and then subsequently, more recently, had uncomplicated Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) for Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy. On exam, there was a centered intraocular lens in the capsular bag. The intraocular lens had a stippled central opacification extending through the visual axis on the anterior lens surface. On further investigation, the intraocular lens was confirmed to be an Akreos MI60 hydrophilic lens. It was suspected that the lens had opacified after exposure to intraocular gas following DMEK surgery",

The patient has an essentially invisible strand ov vitreous that is going to the paracentesis from a peripheral point which is causing peaking of the pupil.

Slit lamp examination of his right eye showed inferonasal subluxation of his PCIOL along with 2+ posterior capsular opacification and cortical material within the capsular bag. He was taken to the OR for an IOL exchange procedure. Intra-operatively, a posterior capsular tear was encountered which was complicated by the IOL protruding out of the tear and vitreous prolapse.
