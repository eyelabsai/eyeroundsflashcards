      "description": "Anterior capsular phimosis is the centripetal fibrosis and contraction of the capsulorhexis after cataract extraction. Individuals with zonular laxity are at increased risk for this condition. Mild to moderate amounts of phimosis are usually not visually significant, but severe cases may require treatment by Nd:YAG laser anterior capsulotomy. Figure1.

      "description": "Scleral lenses are the gold-standard for the treatment of Terrien's Marginal Degeneration because they protect the delicate peripheral cornea from injury and also encourage vascularization of thinned areas of cornea which strengthens the area and also helps to prevent further injury. This patient had a globe rupture in the setting of Terrien's Marginal degeneration and underwent a tectonic mini-PKP. Once a globe has been ruptured such as this, scleral lenses are extremely difficult to fit as they are typically designed with either oblate or prolate corneas in mind. With EyePrint Pro\u00ae, a mold of the eye is taken that is used to generate a 3-D computer model of the shape of the eye (centered on cornea, about 20 mm in diameter). To create a fully custom lens, the optics are overlayed and the desired corneal clearance is customized.",

      "description": "A true excessively flat soft contact lens (or soft contact lens skirt as is the case in this hybrid lens) may have too much material to rest all of its surface touching the conjunctiva. The extra or excess material can \"flute\" up causing a wrinkle at the edge of the lens and/or a bubble. Such a lens is generally uncomfortable because it moves excessively with the blink and because the eyelids hit that elevated material as they traverse the surface of the eye.",

      "description": "Orthokeratology is known variously as corneal molding, corneal reshaping therapy, vision shaping therapy and other monikers. In orthokeratology, typically a myopic eye is fitted with an rigid gas permeable lens that is very flat centrally, but has a reverse curve (steeper than the base curve) in the mid periphery. The lens then flattens and rearranges the corneal epithelium such that the shape of the anterior cornea changes from prolate to oblate. This results in a temporary reduction or elimination of myopic refraction",

      "description": "Posted: March 29, 2017 Scleral contact lenses rest on the sclera, vaulting over the entire cornea and limbus to avoid irritating or scarring those tissues. The amount of space between the lens and the cornea is typically referred to as sag. Sagittal depth actually refers to the entire contact lens from the center of the lens to the plane that the edges circumscribe. Various brands of scleral contact lenses allow you to manipulate the sag in different ways in order to achieve the desired vault over the cornea. Some brands allow you to actually specify the sagittal depth where others require you to manipulate the base curve. A steeper base curve typically results in increased sagittal depth where a flatter base curve reduces it",
