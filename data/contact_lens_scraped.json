      "description": "Anterior subcapsular cataracts (ASC) form after anterior lens epithelial cells become necrotic from a variety of causes including iritis, keratitis, inflammation associated with atopic dermatitis, irradiation, or electrical burns. The opacification of the lens is due to a migration of adjacent epithelial cells into the damaged area and subsequent transformation of these cells into a plaque of multiple layers of myofibroblasts. The most posterior layer of these cells remain epithelial cells and will produce a new lens capsule. Over time the myofibroblasts resolve leaving a wrinkled appearance to the lens capsule. A duplication cataract occurs when a cortical cataract develops in the same area as the ASC.",

      "description": "Many makeup wearers choose to line the inside of their eyelids posterior to the lash line with eyeliner. If the patient is a contact lens wearer, as in this image, the surface integrity of the contact lens can be compromised resulting in increased risk of infection as bacteria more easily bond to a disrupted surface. It can also decrease comfort of the lens and cause irritation of the palpebral conjunctiva as blinking causes the conjunctiva to rub across the roughened surface. The effect can heightened in a toric contact lens wearer since the rotational stabilization required for the toric optics prevents the lens from rotating and keeps the irritant rubbing on the same tissues. In addition to the contact lens complications, makeup can block the meibomian glands and exacerbate dry eye, the effect is worsened if the eyeliner used is waterproof.",

The lenses generally have a laser marking to aid the clinician in evaluating the fit. In the Comfilcon\u00ae lenses pictured, there is a single marking at 6 o'clock on the lens (seen as a bright linear reflection as light artifact reflects off the laser marking in the picture). If the marking is rotated away from the 6 o'clock position, as in the second image, more analysis is required. If the marking stabilizes in that location you can note it and move on if the vision is good. However, if the vision is not acceptable, you can compensate the axis using the LARS rule- Left Add, Right Subtract",

      "description": "Silicone oil is a commonly used material in retina surgery, typically vitrectomy; it\u2019s adherence to silicone IOLs is a widely recognized phenomenon and use of a silicone IOL is contraindicated in patients that have had or are at high risk of needing a vitrectomy. Silicone oil on an IOL is seen as variable sized droplets that are adherent to the surface of the IOL. These can be visually significant to varying degrees based on size and location of the droplets. The picture represents a patient who underwent cataract surgery with placement of a 3-piece silicone IOL about 3 years prior to presenting with a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment requiring pars plana vitrectomy with silicone oil placement and scleral buckle. He later presented with this large silicone oil droplet adherent to the posterior surface of his IOL. He went on to have an IOL exchange with silicone oil removal",

The cataracts appeared as a ring within the lens nucleus in a circumferential pattern following the natural lens architecture. Patient had no subjective visual symptoms. Appearance of the cataracts was stable at 2 days and 6 months post injury. The patient has no known history of congenital cataracts; however, a baseline exam was not available. Slit lamp photo at two days post injury",

      "description": "Posted: 06/26/2025 A 70-year-old man presented to the clinic 2 years after right-sided cataract extraction with a posterior chamber intra-ocular lens (PCIOL) implant performed at an outside hospital. He reported blurriness as well as seeing a \"half-moon shadow\" in his right eye vision. Slit lamp examination of his right eye showed inferonasal subluxation of his PCIOL along with 2+ posterior capsular opacification and cortical material within the capsular bag. He was taken to the OR for an IOL exchange procedure. Intra-operatively, a posterior capsular tear was encountered which was complicated by the IOL protruding out of the tear and vitreous prolapse. He underwent IOL explantation and anterior vitrectomy followed by placement of a new IOL in the sulcus with capture by the anterior capsule",
